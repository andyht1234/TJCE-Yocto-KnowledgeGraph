hi,

This is regarding enabling pipewire support in the yocto project.

I checked out mickledore code from the  git and built the code successfully for core-image-sato.

Looking to enable pipewire support, i discovered that pipewire is already part of *meta-openembedded/meta- multimedia.*

I tried to add these layers using the bitbake-layers add-layer command.
Now when I check for bitbake layers I can see that meta-multimedia is part of the build.

When I run the qemu instance and check pactl info on the terminal within the  instance the default Audio server is shown as PulseAudio.

I want to *disable PulseAudio and enable Pipewire Server*.

PulseAudio is part of the DISTRO_FEATURES.

Can anybody help me with the steps required to achieve this.

regards
-Sandeep

I tried adding the line
DISTRO_FEATURES:remove = "pulseaudio" in build/conf/local.conf  but there is no effect.
