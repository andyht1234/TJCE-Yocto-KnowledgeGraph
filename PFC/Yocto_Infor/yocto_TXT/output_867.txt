Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.0.8 was released
*	YP 4.1.3 passed QA and is due to be released
*	We are now in feature freeze for 4.2 and preparing for final build
in ~2.5 weeks
*	Patches continue to merge into master and there are some good bug
fixes in there. Some version upgrades are merging either due to low risk or
due to the likely need from other components during the lifetime of the
release.
*	Support for parallel ptest execution with a ptest per image was
merged, along with various dependency fixes for the ptest packages to ensure
this works as expected. This takes ptest execution time from 3.5 hours to
around 45 minutes on the autobuilder.
*	The bugzilla was upgraded to the version 5 series which brings
access to the REST API and functionality useful to the triage team. Testopia
was dropped.
*	Regression reports for release builds are now looking fairly
accurate
*	CVE levels in the LTS releases are at higher levels than they have
been for a while which is a concern.
*	We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components
which are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying
to keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex,
devtool, toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more.
Many have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
components!
*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.2. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.2_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
