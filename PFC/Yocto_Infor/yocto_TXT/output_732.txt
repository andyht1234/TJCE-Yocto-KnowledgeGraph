Hi,

I have setup a multiconfig build. This is working fine. I can build using

bitbake core-image-minimal mc:myconfig:core-image-minimal

If I want to clean a specific recipe I use the command:

bitbake -c u-boot

However, only recipe for core-image-minimal is cleaned. The recipe for mc:myconfig:core-image-minimal remains.

I tried including the multiconfig name in the command:

bitbake mc:myconfig:core-image-minimal  -c u-boot
bitbake -c mc:myconfig:core-image-minimal

But it makes no difference: the recipes and/or multiconfig output remain. I can't find any documentation on this.
Does bitbake support cleaning recipes for multiconfig builds? Do I have the syntax wrong?
Is my only option to delete the entire tmp directory and build from scratch each time?
If I manually delete the multiconfig output it is not rebuilt because the sstate cache doesn't know its missing (because it was not cleaned properly)
