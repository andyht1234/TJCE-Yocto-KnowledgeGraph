Hi all,

I'd like to build core-image-minimal-xfce for qemux86-64. I'm on Dunfell.

At first, Xorg didn't start properly but I could fix that by adding package xkeyboard-config manually to the image. Now Xorg seems to start (displays a mouse cursor), but the screen is otherwise black. At some point the screen flickers and I see a window for the fraction of a second, but then the screen goes dark again.

I've attached what Xorg prints on stderr.

There's heaps of error messages and I could go through them and fix them one after the other, but I figure something is broken on a fundamental level. After all, core-image-minimal-xfce should be expected to work, even if it's Dunfell, not?

Can you tell me what's causing my problems?

I'm on the Dunfell branch tip as it was on October 13th on both poky and meta-openembedded: https://gitlab.com/manuel_wagesreither/bora-proj/-/blob/xfce/kas/bora-xfce.yml#L32

Regards,
Manuel

Hi all,

I've also been reproducing this issue for a few days, and I haven't
found a fix yet.
Does anyone have an idea, to fix it?

Kind regards,
Thomas

I realized `core-image-minimal-xfce.bb` adds `packagegroup-core-x11` to IMAGE_INSTALL.
Yet, 
* It doesn't add `x11` to IMAGE_FEATURES which would do the same but perhaps a bit more.
* It doesn't add `x11-base` to IMAGE_FEATURES, which would add `packagegroup-core-x11-base` to IMAGE_INSTALL and perhaps a bit more.

Hence I added `x11` and `x11-base` to IMAGE_FEATURES and it changed things in so far as when the flickering occurs, the black screen changes into a gray screen.

Regards,
Manuel

Hello Manuel,

The regression is linked to the update of the libx11 from 1.8.0 to
1.8.1.
While waiting for a fix you can revert the commit that updates libx11
(7918a25736a7).

Kind regards,
Thomas
