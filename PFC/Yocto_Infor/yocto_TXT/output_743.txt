Greetings,

I built an Aarch64 client image with core-image-weston from master. Now I want to access the running machine via ssh. Usually, I would do this by adding the following to the qemu call when not using the runqemu script:

-device virtio-net-device,netdev=user0 -netdev user,id=user0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22

Is it possible to add this to the runqemu script via local.conf or so?

Regards

You can probably just add 'slirp' parameter to runqemu?

runqemu slirp

was indeed enough to access via

ssh -p 2222 root@localhost StrictHostKeyChecking=No

Thanks!
