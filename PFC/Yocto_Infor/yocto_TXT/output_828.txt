Dear community,

I am trying to build an image for a raspberry pi, that includes libcamera and gstreamer, such that I can set the streaming source:
gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw,width=640,height=480 ! autovideosink

However, gst-launch is unable to find libcamerasrc.

How do I configure my build to do this?

I include libcamera using IMAGE_INSTALL and enable the libcamera gst PACKAGECONFIG.

Best regards

Hi,

The gstreamer plugin is packed in different package so you need to install
them

IMAGE_INSTALL += "libcamera-gst"
