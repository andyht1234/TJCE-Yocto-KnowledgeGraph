I want to verify whether the speaker function is normal on the i.MX6 DL board.
HDMI connector has a hot_plug to detect whether the HDMI cable is plugged in.

However, using aplay to play wav format music under the command line does not have this problem
Test with IMX player under GUI interface, Is there a way to switch to a speaker to play the sound?
