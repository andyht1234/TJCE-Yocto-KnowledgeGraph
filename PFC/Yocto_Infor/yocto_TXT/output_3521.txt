When I am looking at the grub embedded configuration I not fully sure I understand how this patch, https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=c981ebba29001b8684e9805515576c2350a4e22b. In most case the search.file ($cmdpath) will only not find anything since cmdpath will contains something like this, (hd0,gpt1)/EFI/BOOT.

Thanks
