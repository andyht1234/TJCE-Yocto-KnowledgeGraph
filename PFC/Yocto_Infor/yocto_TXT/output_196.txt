Thanks in advance.

I want to add a handler/hook for do_image task, not for all normal tasks.

I found a solution that works. If there are other more suitable solutions, please let me know, thank you. Everyone is welcome to discuss.

I use the bb.build.TaskFailed event, although it's global, not specific to a recipe. In the handler body, I use e.getTask() to determine whether the specified task failed, and if so, execute my code.
