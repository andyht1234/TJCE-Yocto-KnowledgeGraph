Hello,

I'm trying to add a recipe for timebasedb-toolkit from https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit , but I'm not very experienced with Rust.

I added meta-rust (just to have configuration for Rust 1.66.1) and installed cargo-bitbake. I successfully generated the base recipe and tried to build it. However it fails in the do_compile step.

Before building the package, this configuration is required:

cargo install --version '=0.9.7' --force cargo-pgrx

cargo pgrx init --pg14 pg_config

However, I don't know how to implement such "pre-configuration" to the recipe. Tried to add the commands in do_compile:prepend() and also re-writing the do_compile inserting those commands without luck.

Any hint?

I'm using Kirkstore, Raspberrypi CM4 platform, 64bit

Thank you very much

meta-rust and cargo bitbake are both obsolete.

Please retry with a plain poky master checkout, and if something in
the recipe fails, we need to see the failure log and the complete
recipe as well, to be able to help.
