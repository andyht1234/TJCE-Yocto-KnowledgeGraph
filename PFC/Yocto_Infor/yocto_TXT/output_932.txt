Hello,

I'm working with our team to test supported development OS for our 
AMD/Xilinx PetaLinux distribution built on top of Langdale. The official 
supported Linux distributions are Ubuntu, Fedora, AlmaLinux, Debian and 
OpenSUSE, so we regtest our flow on each of these prior to advertising 
support.

However, the supported version of AlmaLinux for Langdale is 8.5, and 
this is not available for download any more 
(https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos.html).  The earliest version is 8.6, 
with 8.7 being most current.  The 8.5 isos are stripped from the 
mirrors, so url-games dont work here either.

What is the recommended verison of AlmaLinux to test against Langdale?  
Is there a plan to update the Yocto release notes to reflect this?

Many thanks
Kris

We're testing against AlmaLinux 8.7 so I think this is a documentation
issue and the value hasn't been updated to match what we're now testing
against. I've updated master and I suspect we'll follow up with changes
to the other release branches.

Thanks for mentioning it.

Cheers,

Richard

Note that the list of supported host distros is set only for the poky
reference distro with a weak assignment, and not for oe-core or yocto
as a whole. If you do your own tests, and they don't show issues, you
can mark any distro as compatible, or install buildtools tarball to
insulate your build from problematic host tools (such as native gcc
compiler).

AlmaLinux in particular is a spinoff of RHEL and thus extremely
conservative within the same major version.

Thank you Richard - that's great info.  I'll ask our team to do the same.

Regards
Kris

That's understood - thank you.  As there were some changes upstream, I 
wanted to ensure that we have as much overlap as possible, so customers 
looking to integrate our meta layers together with others would have a 
tried and tested path.

Yes - my assumption is that we should be ok with 8.x, but we always test 
against a specific version / versions and document these, to save any 
corner cases causing unexpected failures.

Appreciate the help.

Regards
Kris

Just to loop back, we've updated all the branches to mention 8.7 now
and tweaked some of the other entries too (thanks Steve!).

Cheers,

Richard

This is great news - thank you for your help on this, and to Steve.  
Will the page at 
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html auto 
update at some point to reflect this?

Regards
Kris
