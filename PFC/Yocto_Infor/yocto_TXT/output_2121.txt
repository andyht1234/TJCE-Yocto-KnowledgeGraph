Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.3.5 has been released.
*	YP 3.5 M3 is now in QA
*	All of the known disruptive changes for 3.5 should now be merged and
we're looking at stabilizing up to release in around 4 weeks.
*	We do plan to experiment a little with M4 in this cycle by taking
low risk upgrades before release as this does tend to help improve the
baseline versions in the final release and help reduce our security
exposure. Experience shows issues tend to be introduced by feature changes
and potentially other code improvements rather than recipe upgrades and that
the autobuilder testing generally does a good job of evaluating upgrades.
*	Help in completing the migration documentation would be much
appreciated.
*	If people see intermittent issues in their own builds, particularly
if they're the same as intermittent issues seen on the autobuilder, please
do comment in the bugs mentioning when they happen as the frequency
information does help us prioritize fixing the most common issues.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at record high levels and help is
very much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
