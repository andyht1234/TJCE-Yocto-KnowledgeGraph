Greetings,

Using Poky master, I added go-helloworld to my local.conf file:
IMAGE_install:append = " go-helloworld"

... to build the recipe on 
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/tree/meta/recipes-extended/go-examples/go-helloworld_0.1.bb

I then built "core-image-minimal", but though it seemed that the recipe 
was built, I found no such binary in my image.

What could be wrong?
Thanks in advance
Cheers
Michael.

IMAGE_INSTALL or IMAGE_install?

It should be the first one...

Cheers,

Richard

Oops, yes, silly me! How could I miss this? That was the reason why.
Many thanks Tim :-)

you meant to write:
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " go-helloworld"
