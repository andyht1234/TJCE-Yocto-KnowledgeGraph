Depends, no mainline kernel? Vendor kernel?

Can you share the machine name? Might be supported already in a layer with
-rt.

Cannot…

Generic preempt-rt patch bbappend should be enough…

There are a few details to sort out (like finding a patch compatible with the kernel recipe you want to use, or a compromise of the two), but basically a kernel .bbappend with the following will suffice to just patch the kernel.
FILES_EXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/files:"
SRC_URI_append = " https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.12/patch-5.12-rc3-rt3.patch.gz"

After that, you need a configuration fragment to enable PREEMPT-RT in the build.
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y

Oops, FILES_EXTRAPATHS_prepend isn't necessary in this case. I usually download and store the patch in my layer once I find the right one...

Can you supply an example Yocto recipe that applies the patch, doesn’t even have to be arm based… just looking for baseline I might use to carve out support for my platform.
