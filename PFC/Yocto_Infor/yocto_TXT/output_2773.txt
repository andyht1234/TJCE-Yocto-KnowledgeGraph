Sorry, I meant to add that I have tried adding the following to local.conf:

RPI_EXTRA_CONFIG = ' \n \
    dtparam=spi=on \n \
    dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=16000000,interrupt=25 \n \
    dtoverlay=mcp2515-can1,oscillator=16000000,interrupt=23 \n \
    '

However, this did not make any difference to the interrupts.

Since then, I have manually changed mcp2515-can1-overlay.dts in the kernel build tree (after running bitbake - c do_configure virtual/kernel) and rebuilt the kernel / image. This does result in the interrupt mapping changing, and both CAN channels then operate correctly.

Does anyone know why RPI_EXTRA_CONFIG doesn’t appear to be taking effect?

can you check boot/config.txt and see fi your changes are there in your target ?

Hi Khem,

There is nothing in /boot once the system has started, but if I mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 I can see a config.txt that includes:

     dtparam=spi=on 
     dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=16000000,interrupt=25 
     dtoverlay=mcp2515-can1,oscillator=16000000,interrupt=23 

This is what I could expect.

On a quick scan, this appears to be the same as the one in tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi4/bootfiles - the timestamp for this file indicated it was old, so I had manually cleaned and rebuilt rpi-bootfiles for changes to RPI_EXTRA_CONFIG to propagate.

However, if I bring the CAN interface up:

ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 100000

and look in /proc/interrupts, I see:

 66:          0          0          0          0  pinctrl-bcm2835  25 Level     spi0.0

even though can1 is on spi0.1.
