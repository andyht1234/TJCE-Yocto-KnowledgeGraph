We tried to upgrade the Yocto version from Dunfell to Hardknott.  After successful build using hardknott, we flashed the generated image to the device. But we don't see the libpcre2 package installed under /usr/lib/ folder.

Below are the missing so files after built and installed/flashed with hardknott :

/usr/lib/libpcre2-8.so.0  /usr/lib/libpcre2-posix.so.2  /usr/lib/libpcre2-8.so.0.9.0  /usr/lib/libpcre2-posix.so.2.0.3

No changes were done in Yocto recipe libpcre2_10.36.bb:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/recipes-support/libpcre?h=hardknott

any inputs pl?
