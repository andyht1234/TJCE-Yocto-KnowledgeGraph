Key Status/Updates:

   -

   YP 4.2 rc2 has passed QA and is likely to be released once we have TSC
   approval and the release notes and migration guide are ready.
   -

   YP 4.0.9 passed QA and is also due to be released imminently.
   -

   Patches have started to land in master for 4.3 and the branch is open
   for development
   -

   The OE TSC has been discussing some focused work on improving the patch
   submission and new user documentation. There are currently multiple out of
   date documents in various wikis and READMEs which contain good information
   but also things which are obsolete. The aim is to identify the documents
   which should be merged and turn them into one comprehensive document,
   likely in the Yocto Project documentation set. This new document would also
   address some of the changes in developer background we’re seeing, such as
   being unfamiliar with mailing lists.
   -

   We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
   appreciated.


Ways to contribute:

   -

   As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which
   are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to
   keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool,
   toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many
   have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
   components!
   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.2. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.2_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   <https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs>
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
