Hello,

I'm stucking a little bit by compiling a cmake application which has dependencies
on libs from another recipe.

*1)*
The recipe which provided my libs is a normal debian package which I installed in yocto like this:

SRC_URI = "file://${BP}.deb"
S = "${WORKDIR}"

inherit bin_package pkgconfig

do_install() {
install -d ${D}/opt/package-name/include/
install -d ${D}/opt/package-name/lib
install -d ${D}/opt/package-name/lib/cmake
}

FILES_${PN} = "/opt/package-name/lib/folder"
FILES_${PN} += "/opt/package-name/include/folder"

*2)*
The libs from 1) I want to use in the cmake-application

*2.1)*
*CmakeLists.txt is like this:*

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
project(test)
set(package_DIR /opt/package-name/lib/cmake)¬†¬† #path to cmake package -> Config.cmake
find_package(package)
add_executable(test main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(test package::lib)

*-> I dont know how to set the right path to the Config.cmake. At the moment it points to the host location.*
*I have tried like this ${STAGING_DIR}/opt/... which should point to the sysroot, but no success.*

*2.2)*
*Recipe for the cmake-application in short*

DEPENDS += "package-name"¬†¬† # package from 1)
inherit cmake
SRC_URI="git://....
SRCREV = "...."

S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

do_install(){
install -d ${D}/${bindir}
install -m0755 test ${D}/${bindir}
}

FILES_${PN} = "/usr/bin/test"

RDEPENDS_${PN} += "package-name"

When I make a sysroot from the hole image with bitbake -c populate_sdk¬† and I point directly to path where the Config.cmake is stored, everythings works..
Is there any way to make it work in the yocto build process, without making a explicit sysroot ?

*Thanks*

Those commands only add directories, you still need to copy your files to one of those directories. Use for example:

install ${S}/path/to/lib.so.x.y ${D}${libdir}

Any specific reason for not putting your libs in ${libdir} instead of /opt/package-name/lib/folder?

Also, if you can compile from scratch the software instead of including the Deb package, it'd be a better idea üòâ

I don't think your library package is correctly configured for starters. I would recommend installing your libs in ${D}${libdir} that's where most of the libs are and some variables default are set for those so it's all automagic.

Otherwise, the issue is that the files from your library package aren't made available to other recipes. First because you're not installing your libs. Second, by default only a portion of files installed are made available to other recipes via their sysroot. The portions are listed in SYSROOT_DIRS (https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-SYSROOT_DIRS). If you want to keep using /opt/whatever directory for your libs, you'll need to add this directory to SYSROOT_DIRS. And probably will need to tweak a few other paths to point to ${RECIPE_SYSROOT}/opt for library lookup for the linker for example.

If you install in ${D}${libdir} instead, everything is handled for you automagically ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Easier to maintain that way, highly recommend üòâ

Cheers,
Quentin
