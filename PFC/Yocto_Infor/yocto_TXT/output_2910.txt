Hello ,

To create a service in the rpi , do I need to create a new recipe for it, or can I just create it on the rpi directly, m trying the next method now but as I searched I found that they created new recipe, so creating it directly on the rpi does it really work?
THank you

Hi,
because you are using Yocto Project to generate your distribution you have to create a recipe that does what you need.

In this case you need a systemd service.
See here how to add a systemd service file into a Yocto image ( https://wiki.koansoftware.com/index.php/Add_a_systemd_service_file_into_a_Yocto_image )
