Hi,

Thanks for the patch, this is definitely moving in the right direction. I have
some review feedback.

Firstly, you need to make your first line of the commit messages more succinct
(which translate into the subject line of these emails). It needs to be short
and fit one line, preferably under 60-80 characters.

You also need to line wrap commit messages.

0xa0 is a Non-Breaking Space (NBSP) so I suspect the files aren't in utf-8 but
in something like latin1/iso8859-1. To see if that helps, try using something
like open(html_file, "r", encoding="ISO-8859-1").

Python scripts should start with:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

They should be followed with the author/copyright and license information,
preferably an SPDX-License-Identifier.

Imports should be at the start of the file after the headers.

Python has a handy directory walking function, have a look at os.walk().

The other script would need similar tweaks to the above comments.

Cheers,

Richard

Hi Richard,
I implemented the changes you gave and it successfully modified all the html and css files.
But I noticed an issue, In the script to edit the css script, I discovered that the class name of the <div> tag in the html files are different for some files.
For such files, the banner will overlap with whatever is at the top.
I was thinking of a way to grap the class name of each main div class and add it to the css file but it never came up with anything yet.
