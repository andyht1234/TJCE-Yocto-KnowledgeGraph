Hi,

I'm building an image using a kirkstone release for a banana pi m2
board. I've created wic file with 2 partitions one for rootfs and
second for storage. Storage partition if mounted to /opt/storage and
resized to then end of the SD card.
wks snippet:
part /opt/storage --source rootfs
--rootfs-dir=${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/opt/storage --ondisk mmcblk0
--fstype=ext4 --fsoptions="defaults,x-systemd.growfs" --align 2048
--fixed-size=10M

This works fine. I've also added custom systemd-conf file for
journal.conf which set logs to persistent like:
[Journal]
Storage=persistent
ForwardToSyslog=yes
RuntimeMaxUse=100M

In local.conf I've added: VOLATILE_LOG_DIR = "no" which makes /var/log
non volatile.

When image is build I've added following:

persist_logs() {
        mkdir -p ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/opt/storage/journal
        mv ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/var/log ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/opt/storage/journal
        ln -sf /opt//storage/journal ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/var/log
}

# Create persistent logs
ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND += "persist_logs; "

But even after all those changes, the journal is saved in /run/var ...

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks and BR,

marek

Perhaps its not mounted yet when systemd journal needs it. So it falls
back to /run to store it.
usually I have always done mounting in a pre-init step via something
like initramfs before passing
control to systemd. That worked reliably well.

I've tried to mount my partition before systemd is started but I'm still seeing:
journalctl -b -u systemd-journald
Apr 28 17:42:27 bananapi-m2-zero systemd-journald[133]: Journal started
Apr 28 17:42:27 bananapi-m2-zero systemd-journald[133]: Runtime
Journal (/run/log/journal/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8.
Apr 28 17:42:27 bananapi-m2-zero systemd-journald[133]: Runtime

Apr 28 17:42:27 bananapi-m2-zero systemd-journald[133]: Received
client request to flush runtime journal.
Apr 28 17:51:03 bananapi-m2-zero systemd-journald[133]: Forwarding to
syslog missed 1 messages.
Apr 28 17:51:33 bananapi-m2-zero systemd-journald[133]: Forwarding to
syslog missed 49 messages.

and :
ls -la /var/log
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            26 Mar  9  2018 /var/log ->
/opt/storage/log

Seems OK to me. Any other ideas pls? Thanks.
