Hi,

In 3.1.12, I noticed weston service type was changed to Nofity. This make weston service cannot be restarted by "systemctl restart weston@root" command. The service is then timeout and fail.

Investigating systemd unit document, it seems that the notification message is required for a notify unit to finish its launch. So I tried to add this command to /usr/bin/weston-start script:
systemd-notify --ready The service can be restart normally. Is it considered a bug? Or do we have any workaround?
