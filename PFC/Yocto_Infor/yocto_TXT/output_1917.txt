The logging and re imports are unused, remove these.

Add a comment explaining why you need to add a <div> wrapping the main content.

Hardcoding numbers like this isn’t a great idea.  If the intention is to add the warning on all versions earlier than 3.2, then the regex approach that is commented out would be better.  It most likely didn’t work as regex matching isn’t like shell/windows matching:

pattern = r”^3\.1.*"

A good solution would be to use packaging.version.parse, but that’s not a built-in module so would need to be added to the build. That can wait, the regex solution should be good.

A comment here explaining what the exclusion is for, and why 3.1, would be good.

No need for obvious comments

> +            if filename.endswith('.html'):
> +                # open the html file in read mode

Obvious comment, again, and several times below.

To be fair, the list of impacted versions for dunfell is finite, since 
we're talking about old docs that aren't regenerated anymore. Dunfell 
was migrated to Sphinx (and is thus regenerated by run-docs-build 
script) in 3.1.5. (So I think we're missing 3.1.4 in there.)

For Dunfell, this message will ultimately be replaced with the obsolete 
message common to all other old docs, in 2 years from now, when it's 
obsolete.

Just to give more context, I'm not particularly pushing for anything here.

Cheers,
Quentin

Hi Ross, I tried out the regex solution but I did not work and I also noticed that the 3.1.x doc versions on the documentation website already contains the banner
I thought from 3.1.2 above were not outdate to, I am a little bit confused about which version is the latest.
