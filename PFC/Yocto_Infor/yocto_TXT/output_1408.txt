Hello all,

I have created a basic image of raspberry pi4 with the help of yocto. That is only a bootable image nothing else there (rpi-basic-image). Now I wanted to apply Rt-patch in that. I searched over the internet i am not getting any straight way to do that. Please suggest in me the right direction.
And also eager to know that how to check the difference between them (standard raspberry pi image and Rt patch raspberry pi image) like performance and latency results.

Any output would be appreciated.
