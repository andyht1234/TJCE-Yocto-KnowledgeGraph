Hi,
From all variables which qualify to be set/modified in conf/local.conf, among others those documented
in conf/local.conf template, are any to be set /modified only in conf/local.conf?

There is one YP document (maybe Reference Manual, maybe some other) with one chapter 
listing variables for conf/local.conf. For me it's however unclear if that list addresses question asked here too.
Me was not lucky to had got answer over there.

Regards
k.d.
