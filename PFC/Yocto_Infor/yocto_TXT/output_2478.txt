Hi all.

I have added a recipe to BBMASK to skip the processing of this recipe for now, but when I try to compile the image i get ERROR: Nothing RPROVIDES <recipe> error. It's like I should say to yocto to reparse all recipes but I don't find the way to do it without remove the build directory and build again.

Regards.
José

The issue is that you masked a recipe whose packages are required by other recipes packages. Find where the RDEPENDS is set for this recipe package and remove the package which depends on that recipe package from your image (usually, don't include it), or break the dependency chain there by removing the RDEPENDS.

Hope this helps,
Cheers,
Quentin
