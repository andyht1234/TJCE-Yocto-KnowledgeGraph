Hi... Community

Hope all are doing well

I'm dealing with the yocto dunfell branch with the STM32MP1

I know, how to create the patch for the device tree source (DTS) and add with the custom image

My intend is to modify the busb.c to work with my bluetooth USB dongle
I have create the patch for the same and adding the same way as i does with the DTS file

But, unfortunately, it's causing the issue wile baking the image!

Can any one redirect me to the tutorial to customize the kernel module via patch under yocto ?

All suggestions and comments welcome

Thanks
Mahendra

If it’s in-tree kernel module then you create a patch with your changes and
apply it via recipe like any other recipe is going to do in metadata

However you need to share specific details on errors so someone can get a
better content to help you

Hi... Khem Raj

First of all, Thanks for the swift reply.
Let me brief the case.

Actually, I'm dealing with the TP-Link Bluetooth dongle
I have been enabled it's suitable drivers
However, the things not working well

After some googling, i got to know that to work with the TP-Link Bluetooth dongle, I'll have to apply the patch by making some changes at the busb.c and hci_ldisc.c files
And that's how, I have created it's patches by *git diff --no-index* command *

* FYI: I have meta-custom layer, in which i have created the recpies-kernel/linux/stm32mp1 directory
I have stored, all 2 patches in to the stm32mp1 files

in linux file, i have created the .bbappend file called *linux-stm32mp_%.bbappend*
For the instance, i have added the all to patches path in to the .bbappend file at *SRC_URI*

Now, My problem is,  during the baking of the custom image I'm getting the following errors
*"can't find file to patch at input line 5"*

*Error logs*

For your reference, i have attached the contents of the .bbappend file and patch here

In above .bbappend file, the last two patches are for this modules which i need to modify

Once of the patch contents are mentioned at here

I have also attached both of these patches here

I guess, there might be some issue with the actual source file location mentioned in to the patches
but, I'm not sure

Pl. suggest me the right solution

Thanks
Mahendra

The issue is that the path in your patch is incorrect, it should not have kernel-source/ in it, just remove it.

Quentin

Hi... Quentin
Yes, it works!

I'm able to customise the kernel module by the patch


Many thanks :)
