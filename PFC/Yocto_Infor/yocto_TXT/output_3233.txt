Hi,

I am using tlv320aic3104 in one of my project, The hardware is wired in such a way that the I2C lines from tlv320aic3104 is connected to a separate microprocessor which performs the init.

The SAI lines of tlv320aic3104 are connected to IMX8M SAI lines, I am running linux in IMX8M. ALSA says no sound cards found.

I would like to know whether this kind of setup where the i2c is used by a separate processor and using the SAI lines in  a different device that runs linux will work. Kindly advice

To support that, you will have to write your own card driver or at least
write a device tree sound node with a dummy codec as Linux will not be
configuring it.

Hi Alexandre,

Thanks for your guidance. I have updated my device tree with dummy codec as linux. Still the sound card is not properly added. When i tried to verify that using aplay, i got error message as "no sound card is found". Kindly advice.
