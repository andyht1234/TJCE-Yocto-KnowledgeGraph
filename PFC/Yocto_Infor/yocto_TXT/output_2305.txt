Hi all

I'd like to install my python3 application in a custom folder with all 
local packages and data.


The source code folder has this tree


./myapp/__main__.py

./package/__init__.py

./package/pkg.py


I manage the application by myapp_1.0.bb recipe.

I'd like the myapp_1.0.ipk package contains


/home/apps/myapp/__main__.py

/home/apps/package/__init__.py

/home/apps/package/pkg.py


I try setup.py andÂ  inherit setuptools3 in my myapp_git.bb but 
'packages' is installed under python system folder.


There is a way to customize the path of python package installation?
