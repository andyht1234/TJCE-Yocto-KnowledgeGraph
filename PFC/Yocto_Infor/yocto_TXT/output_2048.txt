Hi Team,

I am facing the issue pkg_postinit. I tried to delete this on firewalld recipe side but I have not identified it. Can you please anybody know this issue please guide me.
ERROR: core-image-base-1.0-r0 do_rootfs: Postinstall scriptlets of ['firewalld'] have failed. If the intention is to defer them to first boot,
then please place them into pkg_postinst_ontarget_${PN} ().
