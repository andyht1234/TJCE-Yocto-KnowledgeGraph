Hello,

I am puzzled by the following final do_package errors for dbus,
glib-2.0-dev etc in the kirkstone branch, that error messages were
never seen in honister and other branches. dbus glib etc are from
oe-core, could oe-core insiders advise what those error messages are
about and how to fix it?

ERROR:  packagegroup-solar-1.0-r0 do_package_write_ipk: An allarch
packagegroup shouldn't depend on packages which are dynamically
renamed (dbus to dbus-1)

Thank you very much.

Kind regards,

jupiter
