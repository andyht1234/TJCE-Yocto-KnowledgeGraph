Hello,

I'm trying to run an existing image (based on Gatesgarth) on a Celeron
6305E NUC. The application running on this image is a media player which
uses Gstreamer for decoding and displaying video.

Performance on this CPU is inadequate (probably due to lack of acceleration
support for decoding and display), and I've been trying to figure out how
to fix that. I tried pulling different tags of the meta-intel BSP layer,
with no success.

So I guess my question is this - Is this processor fully supported by
meta-intel, and if so, when was support added for this generation of
CPU/GPU and how can I get that to work with my image?

Thanks,

Ori Pessach
