Hi guys,
I am referring this link
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71293110/how-to-add-nodejs-packages-to-yocto
as a basuc example to add npm packages in my image.

However,
I see no npm install, no do_install function in the .bb file so got
confused if the packages are actually installing in my image or not.

Can you guys guide me on this. How can I know if the file have been
installed, which directory do I check?

Thanks
Hassan
