Hi all
I move all TMPDIR in another folder
The EXTRA_DISTRO_FETAURES += "package_managent"
PACKAGE_CLASS := " package_deb "

When I build the image the package_manager try to find the debs in the older folder.
I see that this problem is in apt/apt.conf of image working dir.
How can I change manually the value of APTCONF_TARGET?
Where the APTCONF_TARGET value is stored?
Best regards,
MZ
