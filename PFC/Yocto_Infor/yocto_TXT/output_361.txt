I'm looking at the Kirkstone recipe for gsoap
http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/tree/meta-oe/recipes-support/gsoap/gsoap_2.8.106.bb?h=kirkstone
and it downloads from:
SRC_URI = "${SOURCEFORGE_MIRROR}/${BPN}2/${BPN}_${PV}.zip

SOURCEFORGE_MIRROR is defined in poky/meta/conf/bitbake.conf:
SOURCEFORGE_MIRROR = "https://downloads.sourceforge.net"
BPN = "gsoap"
so the URL is:
https://downloads.sourceforge.net/gsoap2/gsoap_2.8.106.zip

But this doesn't exist:
$ wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/gsoap2/gsoap_2.8.106.zip
--2023-07-15 07:23:40--
https://downloads.sourceforge.net/gsoap2/gsoap_2.8.106.zip
Resolving downloads.sourceforge.net (downloads.sourceforge.net)...
204.68.111.105
Connecting to downloads.sourceforge.net

HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found
2023-07-15 07:23:40 ERROR 404: Not Found.

So where is the build getting the file? Does SOURCEFORGE_MIRROR fall
back to a different location?

You perhaps could check log.do_fetch to see precisely where the file
is being downloaded from.

Ah, I didn't realise there was a logfile for that.

For future reference, it uses
https://github.com/yoctoproject/poky/blob/kirkstone/bitbake/lib/bb/fetch2/__init__.py#L1116
to run through a list of atlernates, eventually settling on
http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/mirror/sources/gsoap_2.8.106.zip

Thanks.

A patch to set a working URL would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
