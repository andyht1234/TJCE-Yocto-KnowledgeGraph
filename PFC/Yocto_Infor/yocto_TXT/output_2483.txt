The _virtual notation is not an override. These syntax "fixes" need to be
reverted.

In the case of the kernel override, when it was added, the rock-pi-e needed
the latest kernel (linux-yocto-dev) but now the default linux-yocto kernel
will suffice. So this mistake actually switched the rock-pi-e from
linux-yocto-dev back to linux-yocto inadvertently but at a time when
linux-yocto-dev was no longer required.

In the case of the bootloader override, u-boot was always the default, so this
override was always redundant.

Therefore, in the end, simply removing both these overrides is the best way
forward.
