Key Status/Updates:

   -

   We are now a week away from feature freeze for 4.3.
   -

   YP 4.0.12 is pending TSC approval and due to release
   -

   YP 4.2.3 is in QA
   -

   We merged the 6.4 kernel and were able to resolve the preempt-rt issue
   (thanks Paul!) however intermittent hangs on qemuppc still remain as well
   as questions of x86 reliability on the autobuilder.
   -

   There are patches pending which remove source control revisions from PV
   and move them to PKGV, further simplifying WORKDIR paths and generally
   improving the code and the way AUTOREV works. This allows SRCPV to be
   removed as it is no longer needed. We believe all review discussion has
   been resolved at this point.
   -

   Intermittent autobuilder issues, autobuilder hardware problems and large
   numbers of very intensive rebuilds with low sstate reuse are causing
   challenges in keeping patches flowing. Some intermittent issues were
   identified and resolved.
   -

   Glibc 2.38 merged and a new uninative release was made.
   -

   We continue to see intermittent ptest failures for glib-networking and
   openssh, help would be much appreciated.
   -

   CVE metrics are still high but much reduced for master, thanks!
   -

   We’re happy to be able to announce that some of the work in the RFQ will
   now be progressing, specifically that:
   -

      Marta Rybczynska will be working on the security topic
      -

      Alexander Kanvin will be working on the core workflow topic

Other topic areas will likely be announced soon too.

Ways to contribute:

   -

   As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which
   are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to
   keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool,
   toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many
   have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
   components!
   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
