Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.0.3 was released
*	YP 3.1.19 has been built and is in QA
*	We are now at feature freeze for 4.1.
*	The 4.1 build is planned as soon as we resolve the status of some
pending patches. The known remaining issues are the rust automated tests,
layer setup changes and gcc and rust version upgrades. We also need to fix
some autobuilder errors such as the llvm reproducibility issue with mesa.
*	Several patch series have been problematic in the last week which
has put strain on our infrastructure, particularly the binutils upgrade.
*	The CVE count for master rose sharply again this week due to
multiple issues in vim and tiff. The vim issues have been patched, tiff
hasn't as yet.
*	We have seen a sharp rise in the number of patches in OE-Core,
particularly related to changes in new clang versions. Many of these have
been submitted upstream and/or have good reasons for being present but we
need to continue to work to reduce our patch burden.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:

*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
