Key Status/Updates:

   -

   YP 4.1 M2 has a build in progress and then will go into QA
   -

   Last week there seemed to be a large number of autobuilder issues
   including many non-deterministic dependencies for qemu, as well as a lot of
   intermittent buildpaths issues. These have now mostly been resolved.
   -

   The help received in resolving buildpaths issues was appreciated,
   particularly with the kernel where we seemed to uncover several
   unexpectedly.
   -

   We have enabled buildpaths in WARN_QA by default. This takes our
   reproducibility to a new level but there is some fallout in layers which
   will need to be fixed.
   -

   meta-gplv2 builds have been dropped from master and the layer will no
   longer be maintained.
   -

   We’ve noticed that debug information is still not being processed by
   package.bbclass entirely correctly and it is missing a large chunk of the
   kernel sources for example. RP is trying to debug this.
   -

   There are continued reports of issues with the rust SDK compiler. Sadly
   we just have patches to make x86_64 work rather than getting to the root of
   the issues and cross compile it correctly, which is a concern.
   -

   Work is continuing on the /proc/pressure monitoring code. Initial
   averaging wasn’t working so well but we have an improved approach which
   seems to regulate builds better.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT


Ways to contribute:

   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
