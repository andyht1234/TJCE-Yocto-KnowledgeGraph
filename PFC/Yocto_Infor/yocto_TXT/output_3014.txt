Hi,

I'm not sure if this has been brought up already. After the syntax change
from underscore to colon, I noticed the error when using unset on variables
with override. Could someone confirm if this is expected?

# in bbappend
unset SRCREV:xyz

# in build log
ERROR: ParseError at /../abc%.bbappend:3: unparsed line: 'unset SRCREV:xyz

Thanks,
Zhenfei
