Hi,

Since I plan to work regularly on upstream Yocto and contributing, I 
wonder about the best way to best setup my git repos to do that...

I've started with the upstream poky repo but when I make a commit on, 
for example, bitbake, my patch applies on a bitbake/some-path file which 
does not exist in the bitbake repo (only "some-path" exists in the 
bitbake repo).

Is this something I should address ? I found some patches for bitbake in 
the mailing list that are for "bitbake/..." paths... So, maybe, basing 
my patches on the poky repo is totally OK for now...?

To the Yocto maintainers, how do you manage this (poky repo, combo-layer 
and individual bitbake/doc/meta-yocto repo) ?

Note: I have found the "combo-layer splitpatch" tool but it does not 
look like a full solution... Maybe I'm missing something?

Thanks!

I've been making patches against an integrated poky checkout for many
years, including bitbake patches. They're usually correctly picked up
and applied; you only need to ensure you route them to correct mailing
lists.

Ok, I'll keep it that way.

Thanks!

No, please send patches against the correct git tree, else you are
putting more load on the maintainers than necessary.
This was the cause of:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/Y5Sr9HSWIc5LVzl9@mail.local/

This can silently fail and then you need to wait for 7hours for the AB
to fail and this delays testing for one more day.

We never got to the bottom of what happened to that one. Part of the
patch applied correctly, the other part did not.

Just try to apply your patch on a bitbake repository, it will reproduce.

I tried. This happens only if a 3-way merge is enabled: for existing
files git will strip the leading directory as needed, but for newly
introduced files it will place them where the patch specifies.

Otherwise, the patch is fully rejected (by default) or fully correctly
accepted (with -p2).

Either way, this is a pain for the maintainer, you should send patches
that apply cleanly.
