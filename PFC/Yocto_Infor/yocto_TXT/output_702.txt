Greetings,
I am trying to follow the docs to build Yocto for the Beaglebone Black[1]. I've been able to clone
everything just fine. I am triggering the following #errors when I try to run 'bitbake-image-*':

| /home/steven/temp/beaglebone/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/m4-native/1.4.17-r0/m4-

From reading through the mentioned source files, it appears the problem is probably related to the
symbols _IO_ftrylockfile, __GNU_LIBRARY__, or maybe SLOW_BUT_NO_HACKS. I've tried fumbling around to
see what's defined and what's not. I defined SLOW_BUT_NO_HACKS which got me past freadahead's
#error. That doesn't feel right, though. I would expect it should be falling into the "/* GNU libc,
BeOS, Haiku, Linux libc5 */" sections of both files.

Any advice as to how to track down the cause and "correct" solution? I am trying to build on a
Debian 11 system. I mention that since bitbake warns me about it.

Thanks in advance for the help!
Steve

What release of Yocto are you using? I ask because this was fixed in 2018...

clearly a release before 2017:

Well I feel stupid. I was still on the jethro branch from reading old instructions.

Thanks everyone!
