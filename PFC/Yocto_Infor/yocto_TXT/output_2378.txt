I found information on how to remove python2 from the recipe and add Python3 but I don’t know if/how it will work with NXP. Also, there are a lot of people that say Python2 is needed for dependencies, and you shouldn’t remove it even if you use Python3. But this info is mainly for Debian/Ubuntu, and I can’t find anything regarding Yocto.

if you are using latest release then py2 is more or less not needed
unless you use perhaps packages like chromium ( which is also now
fixed in meta-browser ) but this is for oe-core and meta-oe layers
mainly
there still might be packages out there in other layers which still
need py2 so you have to check your packages that you need for your
distro as well.
