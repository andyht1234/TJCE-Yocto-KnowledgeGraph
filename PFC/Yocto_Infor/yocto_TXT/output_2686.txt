Hi all,


I am trying to model a new recipe off of perf.bb to compile the usbip 
helper kernel code. I have been having issues with the 
work-shared/../kernel-source directory being empty, so I went back to 
the perf recipie and tried:

bitbake perf -c cleanall

bitbake perf


I get the same error about path does not exist and the work-shared 
kernel-source directory being empty.


Is perf.bb only executable in the context of a global rebuild?


Chuck

What release are you using ? We did have some issues with this in the
past, but they should all be accounted for now.

I can bitbake perf, bitbake -c cleanall perf; bitbake perf

perf makes a copy of the kernel-sharel tools directory (it didn't in
the past), so
it should be safe for any combinations like that.
