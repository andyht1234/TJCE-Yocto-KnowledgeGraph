Modify toolchain-scripts-mingw32.bbclass to add a check in
environment-setup script which removes trailing slash in
path of SDKROOT.
This is needed to avoid multiple adjacent slashes in paths
which are produced by appending to SDKROOT.
In reference to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file?redirectedfrom=MSDN
naming convention used for paths and disk drives in windows
should use a single backslash. Even though in some cases windows
ignores double slashes in paths and it might work but it isn't
documented as a right naming convention and does fail in some
cases eg. dir command cannot interpret double slashes and fails.

For example if my SDK is located in D: drive, the environment
setup scripts sets "SDKROOT=D:\" and hence SDKTARGETSYSROOT
gets set as "SDKTARGETSYSROOT=D:\\sysroots\armv8a-oe-linux"
The introduced check removes additional slash in SDKROOT to
set it as "SDKROOT=D:" so all other variables using SDKROOT
get set without additional slash.
