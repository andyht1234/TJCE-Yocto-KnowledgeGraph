Hello,

I want to run Yocto project build on Ubuntu 22.04 running on VMWare. In the documentation at this link ( https://docs.yoctoproject.org/current/dev-manual/start.html#setting-up-to-use-cross-platforms-crops ) , there are three cases, but none of them is for Linux running on virtual machine.
I wonder if it belongs to the category of "Native Linux Host". If not, how to set up Ubuntu 22.04 on VMWare.

Thanks!
Crane

To install Ubuntu on a VMware virtual machine, you can follow a guide 
like this one e.g.: 
https://www.thecoderworld.com/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-vmware-workstation-player/

Once you've got Ubuntu installed on a virtual machine, you should be 
able to follow the instructions as if it was a native host, however, 
your performance (i.e. build time) will likely be significantly worse 
than if it was run directly on the host (w/o virtualization).

I've done this in the past.  Build time in that environment is painfully
slow (an entire day using a decent machine).

Hei,

Indeed – same as natively. However, the VMWare slowed it down by some 50% vs. running the same build on the same machine natively (in my case Ubuntu 20.04).

Best Regards,
