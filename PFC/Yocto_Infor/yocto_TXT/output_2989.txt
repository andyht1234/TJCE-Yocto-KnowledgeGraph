Hello,

I permit myself to contact you because I got a weird issue in my sdk toolchain.

So, as I need " qtremoteobjects" in my embedded linux image, I add it like this:

----------------------------------------------------
QT = " \
qtbase \
qtbase-dev \
qtbase-plugins \
qtbase-mkspecs \
qtbase-tools \
cinematicexperience \
qtgraphicaleffects \
qtquickcontrols \
qtquickcontrols2 \
qtquickcontrols-qmlplugins \
qtsvg \
qtserialport \
qtserialbus \
qtremoteobjects \
qtremoteobjects-dev \
qtmultimedia \
qtwebsockets \
"
PACKAGECONFIG_pn-qtvirtualkeyboard = "lang-fr_FR"
PACKAGECONFIG_DEFAULT_pn-qtbase = "widgets libs freetype tslib gles2 eglfs"

TOUCHSCREEN = " \
tslib tslib-conf tslib-tests tslib-calibrate \
"

IMAGE_INSTALL += " \
bash \
sudo \
environment \
opkg \
os-release \
${QT} \
"

#IMAGE_INSTALL_append_mx6 = " ${MX6TOOL}"

IMAGE_FEATURES += " \
ssh-server-openssh \
"

export IMAGE_BASENAME = "myimage"

----------------------------------------------------
So it's work fine when I flash it in my card, but after building SDK, "repc" is missing in /sysroots/cortexa9t2hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi /usr/bin .Â  More precisly, it is present, but located in:

/sysroots/cortexa9t2hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/ usr/bin/.debug/repc

And when I compile my app, I got the following error:

Pre build error --> make[2]: /opt/poky/MY_SDK/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/repc: Command not found

because "make" seems to try to find repc in "/usr/bin/repc" rather than " / usr/bin/.debug/repc" . But when I link or move repc from " / usr/bin/.debug/repc" to "/usr/bin/repc", it gives me a "segment fault error" when I try to make my app.
I saw a similar issue on the web but it does not resolve my problem: https://e2e.ti.com/support/processors-group/processors/f/processors-forum/902941/processor-sdk-am437x-qt-remote-objects-compiler-repc-missing-from-sdk-toolchain

Does anyone already encontered this problem with qtremote control? Do you have got any idea about what is going wrong?

By advance, thanks for all, best reguards.
