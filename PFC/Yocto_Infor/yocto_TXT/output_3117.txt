Backport for dunfell since we have been running for ~1 week with this
patch in master and the same load limiting may help reduce build
failures for dunfell itself as well as when its builds are running
alongside other branches.

This adds the "-l" option to PARALLEL_MAKE in config.json with an
initial testing value of 50 (the previous iteration of this patch both
had it set to 100 and mistakenly stated that this was a percentage,
rather than an absolute representation of system load ala top/htop).
This option is supported by both Make and Ninja. However, we also
require the "--debug=j" option to be passed to Make in order for the
latter to report perceived system load in the do_compile logs, (which we
need in order to track test values), and since this option is not
supported by Ninja, also add EXTRA_OEMAKE to the EXTRAVARS so that we
can determine if the target load percentage needs to be adjusted.
