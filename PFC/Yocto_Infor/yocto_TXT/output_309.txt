Key Status/Updates:
YP 4.3 M2 rc2 is in QA, rc1 was rebuilt due to concerns about the test results
and a desire to set things up well for M3


YP 3.1.27 has come out of QA but has open questions about toolchain test
regressions blocking release


There were fixes for glibc tests which reduced the number of failures on x86
(32 and 64 bit), thanks Anuj.


There were further fixes for LTP result reliability after discovering error
code and timeout handling issues which answer long standing questions about
changes in test results.


Support for a  new recipe sanity testing task (do_recipe_qa) was merged and
there is a hope/plan to move more “processing” operations over to this task to
improve general parsing time.


The pre-release version of autoconf and a gcc stable update were merged.




Ways to contribute:
As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which are
either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to keep them
alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool, toaster, wic,
oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many have open bugs.
Help is welcome in trying to better look after these components!


There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers


There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs


We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list at:
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing list.
We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help facilitate
this.


Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder intermittent
issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to see by searching
for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.

We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.
