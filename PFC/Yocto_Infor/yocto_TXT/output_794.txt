I'm trying to setup a Yocto build using NetworkManager v1.22.16 and
systemd 244.5. https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html#/etc/resolv.conf
recommends I setup /etc/resolv.conf as a symbolic link to
/var/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf. Initially it was linked to
/etc/resolv-conf.NetworkManager but I've fixed that by adding a
networkmanager_%.bbappend file with:

    ALTERNATIVE_${PN} = ""

But now I find /etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link to
/etc/resolv-conf.systemd, which is itself a symbolic link to
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf. This seems to come from
systemd_244.5.bb:
http://cgit.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/tree/meta/recipes-core/systemd/systemd_244.5.bb?h=dunfell#n289

    if ! ${@bb.utils.contains('PACKAGECONFIG', 'resolved', 'true',
'false', d)}; then
        echo 'L! ${sysconfdir}/resolv.conf - - - -
../run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf'
>>${D}${exec_prefix}/lib/tmpfiles.d/etc.conf
        echo 'd /run/systemd/resolve 0755 root root -'
>>${D}${exec_prefix}/lib/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf
        echo 'f /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf 0644 root root'
>>${D}${exec_prefix}/lib/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf
        ln -s ../run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
${D}${sysconfdir}/resolv-conf.systemd
    else
        sed -i -e "s%^L! /etc/resolv.conf.*$%L! /etc/resolv.conf - - -
- ../run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf%g"
${D}${exec_prefix}/lib/tmpfiles.d/etc.conf
        ln -s ../run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
${D}${sysconfdir}/resolv-conf.systemd
    fi

But there doesn't seem to be any support for making /etc/resolv.conf a
symbolic link to /var/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf. Is there
any way of doing this that I'm missing or is this functionality just
missing?

(Apologies if this is the wrong forum for this, I'm relatively new to
Yocto and systemd).

Thanks.

The NM resolv.conf problem was solved by the following commit. You can cherry pick that.
"""
commit a8ebf23dde9c82dd9d1dcd0fa6de0b4467a0112b
Author: Chen Qi <Qi.Chen@windriver.com>
Date:   Tue Dec 20 02:01:38 2022 -0800

    networkmanager: fix /etc/resolv.conf handling
"""

It really does not matter what the resolv.conf mode is in your case because what NM does is just to send DNS info to resolved.

But if you really want to use the stub mode, a modification to the systemd recipe is needed to support it, maybe via PACKAGECONFIG. However, I don't think this is necessary for you unless you happen to make use of some features that the stub mode provides, which is unrelated to NM.
