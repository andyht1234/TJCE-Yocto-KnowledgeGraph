Hello,

I tried to assign a password to the root user and added the following to my image file:

inherit extrausers
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "usermod -d / -P root root;"

At the same time in the local.conf exists: EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES ?= "debug-tweaks".

Setting the password worked. But in parallel the PATH variable in the environment has changed:

before: PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
after: PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

I would like to understand why this is so. Is this intentional, or is it a bug? The root user can't call ifconfig etc now.
I am not concerned with a production image here, I am aware of the security risks.
I want to better understand the internals of Yocto ...

Best regards,
Matthias
