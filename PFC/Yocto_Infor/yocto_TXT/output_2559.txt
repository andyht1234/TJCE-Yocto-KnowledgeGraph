Hi, guys!

I have a DART-MX8M-Mini machine ( https://www.variscite.com/product/system-on-module-som/cortex-a53-krait/dart-mx8m-mini-nxp-i-mx8m-mini/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=291971056&utm_content=532110069537&utm_term=&gclid=CjwKCAjwh5qLBhALEiwAioods_4YBjAwe9mqeq7pdZ58inI733nhLfbFsKz_EaNXLnY88O6qknOWsRoCuT0QAvD_BwE ) running Yocto Hardknott.

I properly added meta-ros layer and ROS2 foxy distro to our Yocto build by following instructions from here ( https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions#add-meta-ros-to-an-existing-openembedded-project ) ( Sanity Tests ( https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions#ros-2-sanity-test ) pass successfully).

With the help of devtool , I was able to build my custom ROS2 package (containing simple talker and listener nodes - link ( https://github.com/bojankoce/my_first_yocto_pkg ) ). For that to happen, I got some great support from the Yocto community - link ( https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/topic/cross_compile_custom_ros2/86906676?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate/sticky,,,20,2,0,86906676,previd=1636382356558417769,nextid=1636039783275782835&previd=1636382356558417769&nextid=1636039783275782835 ).

Here is the content of my-first-yocto-pkg_git.bb recipe that enabled me to download my source code from the git and properly build the ROS2 package:

DEPENDS = "${ROS_BUILD_DEPENDS} ${ROS_BUILDTOOL_DEPENDS}"

DEPENDS += "${ROS_EXPORT_DEPENDS} ${ROS_BUILDTOOL_EXPORT_DEPENDS}"

# Specify any options you want to pass to cmake using EXTRA_OECMAKE:
#EXTRA_OECMAKE = ""

I currently have a hard time building my ROS2 package that contains only custom ROS2 interfaces (messages and services).
CMakeLists.txt file of that package contains the following lines that are causing the build errors:

find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)
...

rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
 "msg/MessageX.msg"
 "msg/MessageY.msg"
 "srv/SrvX.srv"
 "srv/SrvY.srv"
)

Do you have any idea about what should be included as inherit xxxxx or within ROS_BUILD_DEPENDS / ROS_BUILDTOOL_DEPENDS / ROS_EXEC_DEPENDS... in order to successfully generate the ROS2 package containing custom interfaces?

Thanks in advance for your time and efforts. It is appreciated.

Sincerely,
Bojan.
