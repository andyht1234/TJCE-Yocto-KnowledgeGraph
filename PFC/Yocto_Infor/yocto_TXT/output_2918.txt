Hello. I created a recipe with the following command:

$ devtool add  mosquitto
https://mosquitto.org/files/source/mosquitto-2.0.11.tar.gz

i got the file:

ivr@home-machine:~/work/yocto/build
$ cat workspace/recipes/mosquitto/mosquitto_2.0.11.bb
# Recipe created by recipetool
# This is the basis of a recipe and may need further editing in order
to be fully functional.

SRC_URI = "https://mosquitto.org/files/source/mosquitto-${PV}.tar.gz"
SRC_URI[md5sum] = "638d801e6aac611b41de76d030951612"

SRC_URI += " file://0001-arch-makefile-variable.patch"

# NOTE: unable to map the following CMake package dependencies: cJSON

#       (this is based on recipes that have previously been built and packaged)

EXTRA_OECMAKE = ""

do_patch() {
    patch -p1 -d ${WORKDIR} < ${WORKDIR}/0001-arch-makefile-variable.patch
}

i added the line:
SRC_URI += " file://0001-arch-makefile-variable.patch"
and i try to run bitbake -c patch mosquitto
i got the ERROR: Task do_patch does not exist for target mosquitto
I added the lines:
do_patch() {
    patch -p1 -d ${WORKDIR} < ${WORKDIR}/0001-arch-makefile-variable.patch
}

but i got the same error.

Please tell me what I am doing wrong? Before, when I created recipes
by hand, it was enough for me to add the line SRC_URI + =
"file://some-patch.patch" and the do_patch task itself appeared and
was executed

I think you need to move the recipe from a workspace to the layer first
with 'devtool finish'. When the recipe is in a workspace, it's taking the
source code from the workspace as well, and additional patches aren't used.
