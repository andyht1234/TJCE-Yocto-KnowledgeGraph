Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.2 M1 is in QA
*	YP 4.0.6 is due to build today
*	There have been a number of more invasive bitbake changes either
merged or are queued. This included a move to adopt the new layer.conf
"addpylib" directive for layers with python library directories. Also
included was a new optional bitbake cache mode which includes hash
construction information, we're likely to switch to use this for the
dump-signatures functionality. We haven't merged optimisations for that
cache yet.
*	We have increased the minimum python version requirement to 3.8.
*	Functionality versus parsing speed continues to be a discussion for
some of the bitbake patches.
*	CVEs in master are lower but some have been open for a number of
weeks now.
*	We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.
*	As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components
which are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying
to keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex,
devtool, toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more.
Many have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
components!

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.2. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.2_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
