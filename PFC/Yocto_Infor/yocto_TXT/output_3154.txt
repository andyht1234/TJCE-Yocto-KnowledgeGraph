Key Status/Updates:

*	An issue with eSDK being host specific due to pseudo-native host
dependencies has been resolved and this should resolve a number of bugs
being reported by the community around use of the eSDK.
*	The prserv rewrite is still pending on resolving the issues with
python asyncio.
*	We are continuing to make progress on the intermittent autobuilder
failures. A race was identified in the qemu networking lock handling and
there were some reproducibility fixes. Tweaks have been made to the
autobuilder configuration such as avoiding key generation in more cases
which it is believed may have been running into entropy shortages on the
hosts, or just hitting CPU load issues. Some ptest improvements have also
been made.
*	Despite this progress, we continue to see intermittent issues,
particularly ptest ones. Help is very much welcome on these issues. You can
see the list of failures we're continuing to see by searching for the
"AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT
*	The multiconfig changes in bitbake continue to cause problems, we
still need simpler test cases to reproduce issues rather than huge builds.
The existing patches seem to fix some workloads and break others and current
test cases are very slow to work with.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
