Hi!

I would like to implement an out-of-tree Â ASoC Machine driver in my project. It #includes some in-tree header files such ../codecs/codecX.h. These are however not found when I try to build the recipe. I have followed the example project "hello-mod", but that doesn't require any in-tree header files, so it doesn't help in this case.

What do I need to do in oder for Bitbake to find these headers ?
Thanks!
