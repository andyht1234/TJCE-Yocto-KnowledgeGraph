I have 3 layers:
meta-a:

meta-a
└── recipes-my
    └── mypgk
        ├── mypgk_1.0.bb
        └── mypkg_rel
            ├── config.conf
            └── mypkg.service


  *   mypgk_1.0.bb:

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend_$(MACHINE) := "${THISDIR}/${PN}_rel:"

SRC_URI = "file://config.conf "

SYSTEMD_PACKAGES = "${PN}"
SYSTEMD_SERVICE_${PN} = " mypkg.service"

do_install() {
         install -m 755 -d ${D}${bindir}
         install -m 755 -d ${D}${sysconfdir}
         install -m 644 ${WORKDIR}/config.conf ${D}${sysconfdir}/config.conf

         install -d ${D}${systemd_system_unitdir}
         install -m 644 ${WORKDIR}/mypkg.service ${D}${systemd_system_unitdir}/mypkg.service
}

meta-b:

meta-b
└── recipes-my
    └── mypgk
        ├── mypgk_1.0.bbappend
        └── mypkg
            └── config.conf


  *   mypgk_1.0.bbappend:

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend_${MACHINE} := "${YOCTOROOT}/meta-a/recipes-my/${PN}/${PN}_rel:"
FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"
SRC_URI += "file://config.conf "


I also have a meta-c layer. meta-c/recipes-my doesn't exists, i want to use the meta-b one.

  *   meta-c depends on meta-b,
  *   meta-b depends on meta-a.

In meta-c layer.conf i have this:

LAYERDEPENDS_c = "b"

Layers priority:

  *   meta-a = 14
  *   meta-b = 15
  *   meta-c = 16

Every layer defines a machine (machinea, machineb, machinec)
When I build machinea, the config.conf file from meta-a is installed.
When I build machineb, the config.conf file from meta-b is installed.
When I build machinec, the config.conf file from meta-a is installed instead the one in meta-b which have a higher priority.
When I build machinec I want mypkg from meta-b as-is, why bitbake use the other config.conf file?
Also copying recipes-my/* from meta-b to meta-c/ doesn't work and config.conf from meta-a is installed.
If I rename config.conf to config_b.conf (changing .bbappend accordingly) in meta-b everything works as axpected.

The following line is sayng that you want to select meta-a when you have a MACHINE = every machine you have therefore machinec

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend_${MACHINE} := "${YOCTOROOT}/meta-a/recipes-my/${PN}/${PN}_rel:" 
You can read it as

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend_machinec := "${YOCTOROOT}/meta-a/recipes-my/${PN}/${PN}_rel:"
