Hello

I'm working on adding the wiki guidelines for dealing with pre-compiled
libraries
(https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/TipsAndTricks/Packaging_Prebuilt_Libraries#Versioned_Libraries)
into the main documentation.

I'm trying to test the example recipe, but the latest pre-compiled
versions of libft4422.so are now available in
https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/libft4222-linux-1.4.4.44.zip,
which actually contains a .tgz file!

I know that's absurd, but how would you handle this case? Through a
custom "do_unpack" task in the recipe?

Thanks in advance for your insights...
Cheers
Michael.

IMO that makes it unsuitable for the docs as we strive to have "simple" examples and having some custom unpack task seems a bit too much to me. Anyway, just my 2Â¢ and I don't have any other prebuilt lib to suggest as replacement right now.

Back to the topic:
I think you could have an :append for do_unpack and probably call oe_unpack ( https://github.com/openembedded/openembedded/blob/fabd8e6d07d3cd0cc93c2a0fc804f8c8f316c649/classes/base.bbclass#L158) on this specific file (after it's been unzipped), or even call unpack_file from the OE libs directly ( https://github.com/openembedded/openembedded/blob/fabd8e6d07d3cd0cc93c2a0fc804f8c8f316c649/lib/oe/unpack.py#L50) like oe_unpack is doing. Be aware though that since it is a Python task, your :append shall be Python code too.

Maybe there's another way but I don't see it right now.

Cheers,
Quentin
