I have a python script with its dependencies managed by poetry, which have this pyproject.toml file:

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
flask = "^2.2.3"
graphene = "^3.2.1"
graphql-server = "^3.0.0b5"
pyserial = "^3.5"
numpy = "^1.24.2"

I have a python s [tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
flask = "^2.2.3"
graphene = "^3.2.1"
graphql-server = "^3.0.0b5"
pyserial = "^3.5"
numpy = "^1.24.2"
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
flask = "^2.2.3"
graphene = "^3.2.1"
graphql-server = "^3.0.0b5"
pyserial = "^3.5"
numpy = "^1.24.2"

If I inherit python_poetry_core on my bitbake recipe file, and install it into my yocto image, will my python script get all its dependencies and work?
Or I still need to add the dependencies to RDEPENDS? How about virtualenvs?

The Python build tool, be it poetry or flit or setuptools, will do a build in the environment that the recipe has defined: only the dependencies in DEPENDS, no virtualenv.

The point being that we control the environment and know exactly what versions of what packages are in it.
