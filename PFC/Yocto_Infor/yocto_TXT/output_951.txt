Has anyone played around with the mold linker?

https://github.com/rui314/mold


Curious what the build time difference might be on a large multi-core
machine.

Yes, lightly. I found it similar to lld in many cases, only used it on
native links for chromium
it seems to be better at parallelization.

I have a branch in poky-contrib:ross/mold.  It’s been blindly updated to the latest release but not tested, but the wins were not as impressive as one would hope for most builds.

Worth keeping an eye on though, and if you’re interested then my branch would be a good starting point, at least for showing where work to oe-core needs to be done to generalise the linker choice further.

Oh cool!

I'll run some tests on a few builds.

Thanks for pointing that out.
