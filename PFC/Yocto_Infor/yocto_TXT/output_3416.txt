Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.2.4 was released
*	YP 3.3.1 is in QA
*	Patch merging to master is continuing and we now have a round of AUH
upgrades to process. We've tried to merge some of the easier ones as there
was autobuilder testing availability. This allows people to concentrate on
the areas where there are issues with the automated upgrade and where we
most need the help.
*	Anuj is unavailable for a few weeks so Richard will be acting as
maintainer for hardknott until he returns (assistance welcome).
*	An open letter about open source project work was sent to various
mailing lists highlighting some of the challenges established project face
from a resourcing perspective:

 
<https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-architecture/topic/open_sourc
e_maintainers_an/82722442>
https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-architecture/topic/open_source
_maintainers_an/82722442

*	The multiconfig changes in bitbake continue to cause problems, we
still need simpler test cases to reproduce issues rather than huge builds.
The existing patches seem to fix some workloads and break others. Richard is
trying to fix but trying to fix autobuilder issues and other problems and
these are slow builds to debug.
*	We saw a significant drop in open CVEs reported by the tooling
against master this week (63 down to 18) and hopefully many more of these
have resolutions "in flight". This will allow us to focus on the real issues
and filter out the legacy noise.
*	SMP was enabled for qemu on arm/x86 and we switched x86 to a more
modern cpu/platform
*	One source of the OOM issues on the autobuilder appears to be glibc
usermode testing going out of control and using up all system memory. We are
investigating the best way to mitigate that but it accounts for some of our
intermittent issues.
*	When OOM issues occur an issue was identified in bitbake's heartbeat
events causing bitbake to hang. Ironically this was being heavily used by
the recent autobuilder load debugging code. There is a patch pending to
address this.
*	A rare sstate manifest corruption bug was tracked down thanks to
information from Martin Jansa, a fix has been merged.
*	We have enabled more resource control on the autobuilder for xz
memory/thread usage as that was contributing to the OOM issues. More
investigation is needed into the rpm/deb controls for xz, help there would
be appreciated.
*	Intermittent autobuilder issues continue to occur and are now at a
record high level. You  can see the list of failures we're continuing to see
by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We are working to identify the load pattern on the infrastructure that seems
to trigger these.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.

Current Dev Position: YP 3.2 M1

Next Deadline: YP 3.2 M1 build date 2020/6/16

Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.0.3 is in QA result review, there were ptest regressions but
these look intermittent in nature and hence unlikely to block release
*	YP 2.7.4 should be built this week
*	One of the autobuilder issues where workers were hanging was tracked
down to a NFS incompatibility between the NAS and new kernel versions. The
NAS was upgraded to resolve this at a cost of some short notice downtime.
*	There remain a large number of bugs that we'd ideally like to fix in
3.2 M1 (or M2) but they are "unassigned", there is nobody to work on them.
If anyone has time, looking at these bugs would be a great way to help us.
See:

ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.2_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	There continue to be other intermittent autobuilder issues in both
master and dunfell which we're trying to track down. These ones look related
to the code rather than infrastructure.
*	The AUH is now implemented as an autobuilder job and will be run
from there in future.
