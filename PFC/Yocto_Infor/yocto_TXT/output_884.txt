Good morning.

I made a project for IMX6 platform.

Now I ported it to x86.

I made a layer for IMX6, but some recipe.bb cannot be compiled fo x86, 
or some recipe.bbappend has not a mother, so the bibtake stops.

I to adapt the layer to x86 architecture I put some BBMASK += "" in my 
conf/bblayers.conf for x86 build environment and I excluded every 
unneeeded file for x86.

Can I put the BBMASK in some conf file inside the layer to do the same, 
dependig on MACHINE, using OVERRIDE?

The first idea was put BBMASK in layer.conf, like this

BBMASK_intel-corei7-64 = " \
.... \
"

I'd like to became my layer "auto-configurable" about MACHINE value


Any idea?


Best regards,

   MZ

Have you looked into COMPATIBLE_MACHINE?

Looks like a perfect match for what you are trying to do!
