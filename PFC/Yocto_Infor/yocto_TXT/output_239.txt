I am running linux, installed retext reader but see things like:

In addition, your host development system must meet the following

version requirement for gcc:

- gcc &MIN_GCC_VERSION; or greater

which is great apart from I assume that MIN_GCC_VERSION should be replaced with an actual value

and

Here are the packages needed to build an image on a headless system

with a supported Ubuntu or Debian Linux distribution::

$ sudo apt install &UBUNTU_HOST_PACKAGES_ESSENTIAL;

where I assume the UBUNTU... should be replaced by the actual package.

I assume its just that I am using the 'wrong reader' or doing something stupidly beginner like (I havent done anything with yocto before nor have I used this retext stuff either).

The docs have includes and preprocessing that needs to happen.  You can build them yourself if you want (just run make) but the rendered documentation is available at https://docs.yoctoproject.org/.
