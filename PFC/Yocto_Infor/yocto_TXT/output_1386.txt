We are currently working on two different simultaneous releases of our
product OS. One release is a new major.minor release and the other is a
"dot" release from the previous major.minor.

 We are dealing with some preserver issues. The newer release is getting
some PR values that are less than the corresponding PR values on dot
release that we are also working on.  Both builds are using the same sstate
and prserver.  Is there a recommended way to deal with syncing a PR server
for multiple OS releases?

I have a couple of ideas to do this but it basically involves hacking the
prserver to our specific needs.  I wanted to check with the community if
there is a solution already in place.

Thanks.
Rusty Howell
