Hello All,

I have a question regarding disabling bluetooth of my Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. I know that we need to set "dtoverlay=disable-bt" in config.txt

But how to do it from Yocto? Should I include this in conf/local.conf?

While booting my serial console is stuck here:

OpenEmbedded nodistro.0 raspberrypi4-64 ttyS0

Can anyone please let me know whether disabling Bluetooth will solve this?

Your help will be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Hello All,

Hi

I have a question regarding disabling bluetooth of my Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. I know that we need to set "dtoverlay=disable-bt" in config.txt

But how to do it from Yocto? Should I include this in conf/local.conf?

meta-raspberrypi provide recipe just for the `config.txt` file. I don't know which Yocto version you are using
but on master it looks like this https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi/blob/master/recipes-bsp/bootfiles/rpi-config_git.bb#L1
You will need some bbappend in your custom recipe to extend config.txt wtih `dtoverlay=disable-bt`.
E.g. the bbappend should have the following

```
do_deploy:append() {
echo "dtoverlay=disable-bt" >> $CONFIG
}
```

While booting my serial console is stuck here:

To be honest, it doesn't look like it hangs. There is a login prompt

```
raspberrypi4-64 login:
```
Did you try to hit an enter couple of times and then maybe log in?

Your help will be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

I forgot to mention, I am on "Honister" release. Yes, I added rpi_config_git.bbappend file

Yes, I tried that, but it's not working. May be it's fails to respond for keyboard inputs.

Regards,
Sourabh

can you check /boot/config.txt on target and see if this change is
persisting in your image or not
