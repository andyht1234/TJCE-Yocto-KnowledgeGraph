Hi,

I was able to build my package in Zeus, I am now upgrading from Zeus
to Honister, the same package I could build in Zeus now failed in
Honister at do_package where I installed my libraries and symbolic
libraries links to my own RW locations:

ERROR: QA Issue: Files/directories were installed but not shipped

I purposely separate my application libraries and symbolic libraries
links from traditional system RO library location to my application RW
locations, I know how to handle it, it works perfectly built in Zeus,
I don't need the Yocto QA to police it, I tried to add an empty
do_package_qa() in my receipt, it does not work either. Are there any
ways to disable package QA?

Appreciate your advice either how to fix it or disable package QA.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

- JH

These checks can be disabled. See
