Hello, I'm trying to write a recipe a Perl DBI for postgresql. I'm follwing the same recipe found in:
https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/recipe/192563/ ( https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/recipe/192563/ ) and https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/recipe/190989 /
Howover I'm having errors regarding *db_config* path, which cannot be found during the do_configure
here is my following recipe: https://gist.github.com/ferlzc/9234ccd5c5a084f958ff52c7a08899a9 - I'm using Yocto Kirkstone

Any help is highly appreciated!

There are several layers of problems here.

If you look at
https://metacpan.org/release/TURNSTEP/DBD-Pg-3.16.0/source/Makefile.PL#L42
you can see that we could set
export POSTGRES_INCLUDE="${STAGING_INCDIR}"
export POSTGERS_LIB="${STAGING_LIBDIR}"

But, even with that, do_config will fail to find the postgres version. It
depends on https://metacpan.org/pod/App::Info::RDBMS::PostgreSQL to find
it, and we do not have a recipe for that? (even if we did it is probably
going to be wrong... not cross-compilation). There is another variable
POSTGRES_DATA, but it is not clear what the structure/value of that should
be.

Also, there is no native version/recipe of postgresql. In theory you could
use that to be able to run /usr/bin/pg_config, but there are likely to be
cross-compilation errors elsewhere.
(The lack of postgresql-native also means BBCLASSEXTEND = "native" in your
libdbd-postgresql-perl recipe is a lie).

Short answer: this is not cross-compilation friendly
