Hi,

Is there any way to update my Read Only system (which connected  to the
world via cellular) with local time?

Im able to get the local time zone from ip lookup ... but can't use it to
update the system current time.

Thanks,
Arik

Just use something like NTP to sync the local time. There's a number
of recipes that can do this, such as systemd/ntp/ntpdate.

The thing is that ntpdate syncs system time to UTC

How can i set my system's time according to time zone?

I don't have option to add systemd.

Added alrady tzdata and all time zone folders exist.
The issue is that ntpdate returns time in UTC.

I found a way to get local time zone (by using ip lookup). Now i looking
for a way to use it to update system time

From what i read, there is a way to do this using timedatectl (its part of
systemd).

Anyone knows what recipe i need for that?

Just write a small tool to map the local timezone from the IP lookup
to a timezone name (such as Europe/London) and write it to
/etc/timezone. You could do that with a short ifup script.

That said, for headless appliances working in UTC is absolutely fine,
and for user-facing devices it's perfectly acceptable to ask the user
what the timezone is, as your geo-IP lookup might be incorrect anyway.

can't write it to /etc/localtime ... it's a read only system.


There is an environment variable named TZ, when ever it is changed, local
time is changed as well.

Is there a way (by script or cron job) to set the way system will update as
well?

10x,
Arik

Package /etc/timezone as a symlink to /run/timezone, and write to that instead?
