Dear Team
I'm using poky-thud with meta-raspberrypi and meta-telephony, here I've installed dahdi-linux, dahdi-tools and asterisk 13.13.1, here in yocto image for raspberry pi kernel is 4.14.112 .

when asterisk is getting compiled it is creating chan_dahdi.so, but failing to load it, when I'm trying manually load it, then it is giving issue-

*WARNING[2094]: loader.c:556 load_dynamic_module: Error loading module 'chan_dahdi.so': /usr/lib/asterisk/modules/chan_dahdi.so: undefined symbol: minor*
*[Jul 16 06:17:34] WARNING[2094]: loader.c:1090 load_resource: Module 'chan_dahdi.so' could not be loaded.*

Installing same in rasbian os with with kernel 4.14.114 kernel with same dahdi source, asterisk 13.18.2 is successfully loading the chan_dahdi.so module.

so I'm not able to get reason of this issue with yocto image asterisk.

Regards,
Prashant Singh
