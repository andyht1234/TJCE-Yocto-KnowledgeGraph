Hi Steven,

I am a bit confused, but can try to show you what I typically do.
In my custom meta-my-layer I add to layer.conf:

#-->
LICENSE_PATH += " ${LAYERDIR}/custom-licenses"

CUSTOM_COMMON_LICENSE_DIR := 
'${@os.path.normpath("${LAYERDIR}/custom-licenses")}'
BB_HASHBASE_WHITELIST_append = " CUSTOM_COMMON_LICENSE_DIR"
#<--

underneath the custom-licenses dir in this meta-my-layer I put the 
custom "hello-license".

Once you did something like mentioned above you can add the license to 
the recipe you use to build the funny component of your supplier.

example_0.1.bb:

LICENSE = "hello-license"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = 
"file://${CUSTOM_COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/hello-license;beginline=5;endline=12;md5=36e6988a930e054886e6af19372edb07"

If you want to get fancy, since it does not seem to be an open source 
license, you can mark it also as:

LICENSE_FLAGS = "commercial" in the recipe

but then you need to whitelist e.g. in your local.conf to be able to 
bitbake it:

# whitelist example recipe, which is under a commercial license
LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial_example"

Hope this helps,
