I've had similar issues recently with kas-container and podman. What was required were two things:
 - passing --tmpfs /tmp to podman run,
 - increase pids_limit in container.conf (your system's), we've set it to 1000000 abritrarily for now and it seems to run fine for the few builds we've made so far),

Hope this helps,
Cheers,
Quentin

I don't think --tmpfs is an option, but I modified my kas-container script to
add a "--tmpdir /tmp" option (and verified it with ps while running)

There seem to be a couple places to update the uid/gid mappings. Originally,
following the podman docs, I created /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid and had them
both contain:

	trevor:100000:123456

I wasn't seeing any problems with the couple builds that I did, but based
on your suggestion I had a look at /etc/containers/storage.conf and added
(uncommented):

	remap-uids = "0:1668442479:1000000"
	remap-gids = "0:1668442479:1000000"

I also bumped /etc/sub{gu}id to:

	trevor:100000:1000000

but I'm still seeing pseudo failures even after incorporating both of your
suggestions.

I expanded my testing and discovered that using kas-container with podman on
my openSUSE 15.3 machine I can't build qemux86 for anything including and past
dunfell. All failures are due to pseudo.

qemux86 builds using kas-container with podman on openSUSE 15.3:
	working:
	- thud (2.6)
	- warrior (2.7)
	- zeus (3.0)

	not working:
	- dunfell (3.1)
	- gatesgarth (3.2)
	- hardknott (3.3)
	- honister (3.4)
	- master

I did a kas-container build on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine using docker of qemux86
on master and it worked.

I suspect something changed with pseudo in 3.1 and beyond that either isn't
working well with openSUSE 15.3 or isn't working well with podman.

Next I'll try using docker instead of podman.

It's good to see people stressing kas-container with podman - but it's
likely still under-tested. Nevertheless, I'm happy to help if you want
to improve this path.

I wasn't talking about uids or gids, but pids_limit in containers.conf for podman on your host. See: 
https://man.archlinux.org/man/containers.conf.5.en

We discovered that it just had nothing to do with Bitbake/pseudo or whatever, because with a fork bomb we reached the max of 2048 processes (within the container) before the container started to fail us.

Without those two changes, I've never been able to successfully build even core-image-minimal for qemu-x86_64.

Cheers,
Quentin

To be fair, I didn't take the time to formulate correctly and point to the docs ☺️

podman run --help | grep tmp

Does return it though. It's just that some options are specific to subcommands and not the whole set of supported subcommands. The docs.podman.io website is a gold mine, I only ever go to that place to find about parameters ☺️

Feel free to do it, I don't use kas-container, I use the kas container from ghcr.io directly so this won't impact me and I wouldn't be able to "maintain" this part and see if something breaks it. I anyway have as many clues as you have on why this fixes pseudo issues so I wouldn't be able to write a better commit log than you'd do.

I'll read the script though to see if I've missed any important parameter to set.

Re: not needing the pids_limit. It seemed to be ok at first but I'd have intermittent fails much later in the build. Increasing it made all my problems go away (well.. for now 😁).

Cheers,
Quentin

Okay. Can I add your SOB line to the patch?

Thanks for asking. I wouldn't have minded were you to send this patch without my SoB but if you want you can use foss+yocto@0leil.net.

The important being that it's fixed ☺️

Could you send your patch to the kas mailing list for discussion? It
will probably just need a bit tuning on the reasoning:

Rootless podman uses fuse-overlayfs for the rootfs, and that seems to be
incomplete or otherwise incompatible with pseudo. When starting in
--isar mode, thus privileged, a real overlayfs is used, and that works.
And the build folder is not affected by this as it is mounted from the host.
