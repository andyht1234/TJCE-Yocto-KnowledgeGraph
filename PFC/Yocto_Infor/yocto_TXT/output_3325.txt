I am using the meta-intel layer with a machine configured to intel-core-i7
and core-image-Sato. A very basic build and using bmaptool to generate an
image from .wic to a usb stick.The problem is that the kernel hangs on the
last line in the following picture, I think it does not see the filesystem.
So, what do you think is the solution?
