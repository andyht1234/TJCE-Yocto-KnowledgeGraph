From: Richard Purdie <richard.purdie@linuxfoundation.org>

The autobuilders have 128GB memory, we don't want them using 50% which is
the default, 5% should be enough. Also limit the number of threads down
from 48 to something reasonable. This may be partly causing some of our
performance issues?

(cherry picked from commit 19b4e74b3960174238acc79fd112f55706bc7385)
