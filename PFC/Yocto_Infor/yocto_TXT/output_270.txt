Hi there

I have a problem with a fresh build in that I was able to successfully
build the image and the SDK. After changing some options (unfortunately
I don't remember what 🙈️) I now get an error trying to build the SDK
that the «sdk_provides_dummy_target» is for a different architecture.

I found such errors when I search for it (google) and always people
state that changing the package type (deb/rpm/ipk) could solve the
issue. But even when I completely leave out any PACKAGE_CLASSES I get
the same error.

I have no idea why this suddenly appeared, I haven't changed anything
concerning multilib (I don't even want or need this) or concerning the
architecture in general.

How come there is an architecture called «sdk_provides_dummy_target»?

Can anybody help please?
