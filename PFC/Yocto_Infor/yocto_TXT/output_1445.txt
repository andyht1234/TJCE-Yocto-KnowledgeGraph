Hi... There

Hope all are doing well

Right now, I'm dealing with the *TP-Link Bluetooth dongle*.
My goal is to add the Bluetooth functionality with the Yocto custom image
After some research i got to know that the Bluetooth dongle, that I'm using is unsupported by activating the Bluetooth drivers only by menuconfig
I'll have to manually add the *rtl8761b_fw.bin* file with the image

Here is the good post for the same
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1370663/bluetooth-scan-doesnt-detect-any-device-on-ubuntu-21-10

Now, my problem is, I'm getting some errors after adding it's firmware file

Here is the steps, which i have gone through

1. Created linux-firmware file under recpies-kernel directory

2. added the rtl8761b_fw.bin to /files directory under linux-firmware file

3. Created .bbappend file as per the available kernel name called *"linux-stm32mp_%.bbappend"*

4. installed the .bin image with the custom recipes file called custom-image.bb as follows
# Drivers for the TPL-Link Bluetooth dongle
IMAGE_INSTALL += "linux-firmware-rtl8761b_fw"

5. bake the image with bitbake custom-image

here is the tree of the directories

The error screenshot is mentioned here

The content of the .bbappend file is listed here

Can any one help me here ?
All suggestions and comments welcome :)

Regards
Mahendra Sondagar

there already is a linux-firmware recipe 
meta/recipes-kernel/linux-firmware/linux-firmware_20220708.bb

OK

bbappend should be for linux-firmware recipe.

I think it will be called something else then perhaps 
linux-firmware-rtl8761b or some such. Avoid using '_' in the name as its 
used a version separator and can confuse the packaging

you have not followed what I said. The bbappend is still a kernel
bbappend, so please make a bbappend for linux-firmware recipe
instead as suggested.

secondly, the bbappend itself has issues

PACKAGES =+ "${PN}-rtl8761b"
FILES_${PN}-example = "/lib/firmware/rtl_bt/rtl8761b.bin"

PACKAGES and FILES do not match. what you want is something like

PACKAGES =+ "${PN}-rtl8761b"
FILES_${PN}-rtl8761b = "/lib/firmware/rtl_bt/rtl8761b.bin"

then in image add.

IMAGE_INSTALL += "linux-firmware-rtl8761b"
