I am developing a pair of driver modules that share some functionality. Thus it would be convenient for the source files of the drivers to share a directory with the source files of the shared functionality and for both to be built at the same time. Is this feasible using one recipe under Yocto or do I need to separate the drivers and create a library? Any other suggestions would be welcome.
