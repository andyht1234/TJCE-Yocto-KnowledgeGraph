I have a platform based off a aarm64 Xilinx based kernel, which is not a compliant mainline kernel... so, I will need to go the preemp-rt patch route.

Can you supply an example Yocto recipe that applies the patch, doesn't even have to be arm based... just looking for baseline I might use to carve out support for my platform.

Thanks,
Steve
