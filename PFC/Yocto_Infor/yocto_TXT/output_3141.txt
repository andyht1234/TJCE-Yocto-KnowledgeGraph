Hi All,

We are currently trying to create a recipe for TimescaleDB and are
running into issues with the cmake build system that relies on
`pg_config` for configuration. We managed to get `pg_config` into the
recipes build environement by following this thread about building
PostGIS
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51496061/using-files-generated-by-other-recipes-in-yocto
however it doesn't return any useful values.

We would be very interested to know if anyone has successfully built a
postgresql extension and could share how you did it or point us to a
recipe we can take inspiration from.

In any case we would like to publish this recipe to a public layer once
we figure it out.

Best regards,

Morgan
