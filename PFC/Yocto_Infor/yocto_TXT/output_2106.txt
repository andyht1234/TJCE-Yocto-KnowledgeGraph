Hi,

I am resending this from my regular email client because I think that my original submission using git sendmail was messed up in my GIT config so it didnâ€™t make it to the list.  (I did send an email using git sendmail to Armin).

We need this change to meta-security to be compatible with the referenced change made in poky / OE-core.  Otherwise there is an error as I reported weeks back.  I believe that this patch fixes it.  I have used it in both master branch and in dunfell.

We also need this to be back ported to all the same branches of meta-security to correspond to all the branches on poky to which the 33efd9351702e08a53e6512e235f947e4f9e914f commit was back ported.  This includes dunfell.

It is easy to find in a poky branch by grepping for do_populate_cve_db.

From a different perspective, there could also be a case to revert the original changes as I notice that populating the CVE database is not necessarily something that we would want to be part of someone running a fetch all operation for a target image, because the fetch for the CVE database would likely be run again later at the time of building the image.  This could be a matter of discussion (if not already discussed).  But I can work with it either way.

Thanks!


Regards,

Darcy

Subject: [meta-security][PATCH] isafw.bbclass: update task dependency on cve-update-db-native
From: Darcy Watkins <darcy@xstreamworship.com>

poky commit: 33efd9351702e08a53e6512e235f947e4f9e914f
(or OE-Core commit: f5f97d33a1703d75b9fd9760f2c7767081538e00)
had renamed the do_populate_cve_db task in cve-update-db-native
to do_fetch.

Need to update the do_build task dependency accordingly.
