Dear all,

Currently I have created an image which upon boot mounts my rootfs as readonly in an overlay with my data partition. I set out to change the FS type of my rootfs to something that is actuall read-only like squashfs, however I am getting a kernel panic whenever I boot saying:

"Not syncing: vfs: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-blick(179,2)"

The steps I took to convert to a read-only rootfs:

  *   Change -fstype in .wks file to squashfs
  *   Changed IMAGE_FSTYPE= "squashfs wic.bz2", in local.conf, however I do not believe this is necessary actually

Are there steps I am missing? I believe that IMAGE_FEATURE = "read-only-rootfs" should not be necessary as I am mounting the rootfs in an overlay before starting /sbin/init , but I might be wrong.

Kind regards,

Léon van de Beek

Did you check that your kernel actually supports squashfs as rootfs? There is a Kconfig option for it IIRC.

Since it's an image feature, it's not going to impact anything outside of the image recipe but I don't know exactly what this is doing from memory.

Cheers,
