I am having trouble creating files with cyrillic characters on a yocto generated image.

For eg. If I try to create a file like :
# touch  1Черная

I do get:

# ls
1??????

I have verified that my locale has utf8 support:

# locale
LANG=en_GB.utf8
LC_CTYPE="en_GB.utf8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_GB.utf8"
LC_TIME="en_GB.utf8"
LC_COLLATE="en_GB.utf8"
LC_MONETARY="en_GB.utf8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_GB.utf8"
LC_PAPER="en_GB.utf8"
LC_NAME="en_GB.utf8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_GB.utf8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_GB.utf8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_GB.utf8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_GB.utf8"
LC_ALL=en_GB.utf8

What could I be missing and how can I create files with cyrillic characters?

Regards
Ash

Is your file created with the wrong name or is it actually just the
'ls' output that doesn't support unicode characters?

If you're using busybox, I think these configuration options could be
of interest:

CONFIG_UNICODE_SUPPORT
CONFIG_LAST_SUPPORTED_WCHAR

You'll find this at the bottom of "Settings -> Support Unicode" when
using menuconfig.

I have enabled those options in Busybox to no avail.

I still cant see my files :

# touch 1Чернаяг
# ls -l 1Чернаяг
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root             0 May  3 13:35 1???????

The file is created though and visible in bash completion and I am
able to delete the file as well.

Is this working for you on yocto ?

Ash
