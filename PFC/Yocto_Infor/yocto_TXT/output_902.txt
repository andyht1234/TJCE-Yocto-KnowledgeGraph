Hi,
When i try to add systemd using the below config in local.conf

DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
 VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"

Iam getting transaction error .
How to resolve this issue?.

Downloading Packages:
Running transaction check
Transaction check succeeded.
Running transaction test
Error: Transaction check error:
  file /sbin/telinit conflicts between attempted installs of
systemd-1:244.5-r0.cortexa8hf_neon and sysvinit-2.96-r0.cortexa8hf_neon

So something in your image is causing it to install both systemd and sysvinit.

You’re not disabling sysv, so one of your recipes might be pulling in both.

Try removing the lines you added and instead set INIT_MANAGER = “systemd”.  This does a more comprehensive switch to systemd than the two lines you are using.

And the manual is being updated precisely on this point.
Cheers
