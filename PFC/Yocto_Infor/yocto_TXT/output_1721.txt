Hello,

Where are the settings/configuration files within the Yocto environment to configure/re-route LCD video signals from the HDMI port to the LCD_Data pins on the expansion connector P8 of beagleboneblack? A custom resolution and refresh rate needs to be set to work with external LCD. Similar subject to: https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/meta-ti/message/14240. Possibly @Vivien Didelot may be able to answer this.
