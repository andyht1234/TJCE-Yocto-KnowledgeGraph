The commit ed3a97f7b2e4 ("rockchip-wic.inc: don't let wic edit fstab")
removing this ability was introduced to fix an issue in the wic tool in
OE-Core in which wic partitions whose "mountpoint" is not a valid path
are still added to fstab.
This was eventually fixed in OE-Core in commit 7aa678ce804c
("wic:direct.py: ignore invalid mountpoints during fstab update") which
is part of release Honister (3.4) and later.

Therefore, it should be safe to now let wic update fstab again for
partitions with a valid mountpoint path. The benefit being that the wic
partitions with a mountpoint are now automounted at boot.

restore fstab update by wic

Since wic now correctly handles partitions without a valid mountpoint path and
does not add them to fstab, we can let wic update fstab again so let's do it.

This makes partition automounting work again.

This was tested on a Kirkstone (4.0.4) poky-based core-image-minimal on a
PX30-uQ7 (Ringneck) SoM on Haikou devkit
(https://git.theobroma-systems.com/yocto-layers/meta-theobroma-systems-bsp.git/)

This should be safe to backport to kirkstone and honister too.
