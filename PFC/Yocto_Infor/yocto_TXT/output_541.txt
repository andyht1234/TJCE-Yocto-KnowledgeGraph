Hi,

I would like to copy a file (logo.pnm) from the
yocto/uboot/sources/meta-fsos-jetson/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-tegra/
  using the linux-tegra_%.bbappend to the

yocto/uboot/build-jetson/tmp/work-shared/jetson-nano-emmc/kernel-source/drivers/video/logo

It is necessary that the file is copied every time if the build is
rerun with the . yoctoWF.sh && compile_kernel. It resets the
directories to default before every rerun.

Contents of the linux-tegra_%.bbappend:

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"
SRC_URI_append = " \
                                    file://logo.pnm
                                    file://logo_custom.patch" \
                                   .... \"
do_unpack_append() {
     os.system("/bin/cp -rf logo.pnm" ${S}/drivers/video/logo")
}

do_install_append() {
     install -m 644 {B}/logo.pnm ${D}/drivers/video/logo/
}

The problem is that it doesn't work, it copies nothing there and there
are also no error messages. I tried to include logging, but the
standard .bb doesn't include it and that is
why I can't use it in the .bbappend. As I know I can use some kind of
${WORKDIR}, but
I don't know how.
