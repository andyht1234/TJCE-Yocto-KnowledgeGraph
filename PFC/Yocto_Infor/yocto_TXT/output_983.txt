See attached graphs!

I don't know why there are two peaks that you can easily see on the 
linear scale distribution
but the 3 graphs show why I picked the 3 second cutoff.

Below is histogram data for a 0.1 second bin of  the tail of the 
distribution.

I can share the raw data or the 0.001 ms binned version if anyone is 
interested.

I'm guessing but I suspect that the lower latency distribution is just 
from when

the Yocto AB workers are idle. The builders in the cluster at WR are always
busy, sometimes needlessly,  so I didn't consider that initially.

Sigh, that's obviously wrong since this data is only collected when 
running bitbake!

Maybe it's the arm vs the intel workers?

I'll stop speculating until I look at the data a bit more...
