Hi,

I was using the [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/yoctoproject/poky/commits/master)
for shallow clones, and noticed that while its syncing commits, the tags aren't
being pushed there.

The last sync with tags happened in February, so its missing all tags since.

Thanks,
Nemo

I've been trying to get this automated but I've resolved it for now.

Cheers,

Richard
