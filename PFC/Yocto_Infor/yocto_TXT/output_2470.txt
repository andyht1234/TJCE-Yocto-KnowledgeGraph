We are building our software with a Yocto SDK we created against our imx8m
board. We would like to be able to execute unit tests (C++ tests written in
Google Test) quickly without having to copy our unittest binaries over to
an actual imx board to execute them. For sanity, we are also building our
linux distro for MACHINE=qemux86-64 and beaglebone-yocto.  So we have SDKs
for imx8m, qemux86-64 and beaglebone-yocto.

Is there a MACHINE type that we could build that would be suitable for
executing compiled C++ google test binaries directly on Ubuntu 18.04 or
20.04?
Thanks

I think using qemux86-64 might be your best bet, its fairly automated
with runqemu script
all you would need to do is package up the gtests as ptest package with a runner
