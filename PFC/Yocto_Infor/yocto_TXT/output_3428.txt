I'm working with Yocto Dunfell. I just wanted to remove syslog
from the busybox package by setting VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_base-utils-syslog
to an empty string. But it seems like the syslog.cfg is added to the SRC_URI
independent of the VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_base-utils-syslog which in turn will
enable syslogd again. Wouldn't it be better to include syslog.cfg in
SRC_URI only if VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_base-utils-syslog is set to busybox-syslog?

So something like

${@["", "file://syslog.cfg" ][(d.getVar('VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_base-utils-syslog') == 'busybox-syslog')]}

yes. Please send this change as a proper patch for inclusion to 
openembedded-core mailing list.
