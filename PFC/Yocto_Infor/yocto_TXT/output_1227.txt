Many of the oe-selftest test cases boot up an image in qemu, but if the
host can't use KVM to accelerate the guest then the tests take a lot
longer and may randomly timeout.

Now that oe-selftest can run for qemuarm64[1], switch the
oe-selftest-armhost to use qemuarm64 so that KVM can be used. This
should mean faster and more reliable tests, which also cover another
architecture.
