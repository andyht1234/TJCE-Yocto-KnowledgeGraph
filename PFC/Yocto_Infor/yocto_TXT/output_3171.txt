Hello,

I have a problem with the archiver. I want to use it to export the sources used in our image for license compliance (GPL etc.).
We have a BSP supplier that supplies the Yocto system and the sources to build it in a mirror directory.

Now, when I use the archiver (mode: original) the exported sources don't contain the sources from the mirror, but only other files like patches.

To analyse this problem I put some extra logging into the archiver.bbclass to inspect the variable contents, and it seems the "local" variable where the archiver is looking for the sources to export doesn't fit with the path of the actual sources. This leads to the archiver just skipping that URL and proceeding.

For example for the systemd recipe it has the variable URL="git://github.com/systemd/systemd.git;protocol=git" and therefore it decides to look at local="<builddir>/downloads/git2/github.com.systemd.systemd.git"
But that file doesn't exist.
I inspected the do_fetch and do_unpack logs to find that the fetcher resolves "git://github.com/systemd/systemd.git;protocol=git" with returning the corresponding file from the mirror file:///<mirrorpath>/gitshallow_github.com.systemd.systemd.git_46659f7-1_master.tar.gz<file:///%3cmirrorpath%3e/gitshallow_github.com.systemd.systemd.git_46659f7-1_master.tar.gz>
The do_unpack task then unpacks tar -xzf <builddir>/downloads/gitshallow_github.com.systemd.systemd.git_46659f7-1_master.tar.gz
Which is possible because there is a symlink, I guess that was created by the fetcher
<builddir>/downloads/gitshallow_github.com.systemd.systemd.git_46659f7-1_master.tar.gz -> <mirror>/gitshallow_github.com.systemd.systemd.git_46659f7-1_master.tar.gz

So the problem seems to be that the archiver expects the sources in downloads/git2 but the fetcher creates the symlink in downloads and with additional pre- and postfiexes on the filename.

Sadly we are still on sumo, but at least for the archiver class there isn't any relevant change to hardknott. At least a dunfell upgrade is incoming in the next weeks.

Best regards,

Christoph

If the archives you've been given have names starting with
'gitshallow_' then it's likely that the following variables were set in
local.conf or in a distro conf file to generate them:

    BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS = "1"
    BB_GENERATE_SHALLOW_TARBALLS = "1"
    BB_GIT_SHALLOW = "1"
    
Could you make sure those are set in your configuration? If they're not
then the archiver may not be looking for the file names you have.

If things still don't work after that you could try backporting the
archiver class from hardknott and using the mirror archiver mode. That
mode is written to pick up the mirror tarballs from the downloads
directory so it should be able to handle your situation.

Thanks,
