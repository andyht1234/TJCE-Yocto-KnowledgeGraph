Dears,

I am looking for a way to include sample code for DSP (xtensa) with
Yocto/Linux. what would be the procedure to include such a code and
eventually interprocessor communication between xtensa core and CPU under
Yocto/Linux?

Thank you.
BR/J

Hello Jack,

I think we do not have support for Xtensa architecture working out of
box upstream. Although it should be possible to add it with little
effort, but no one has spun patches to do so
thus far.

Thanks

Hello Khem,

Thank you for the information.
Is it about adding support for the xtensa build system (toolchain)? Is it
work for heterogeneous SoC (CPU/ARM + DSP/xtensa) as well?

Thank you.

I can think of few ways

build your Xtensa firmware outside yocto and let yocto package it via 
recipes for prebuilts and build ARM system with yocto should work well

second option is to integrate Xtensa support into OE and then use 
multiconfig feature to build firmware for heterogenous systems.
this will be preferred and forward looking for future but it will be
more work
