Hi,

I'm trying to add nerdctl to an image using kirkstone release for
meta-virtualization.
I've added bbappend with following fix:

SRC_URI = "git://
github.com/containerd/nerdctl.git;name=nerdcli;branch=main;protocol=https"

(branch name in original recipe is master but main is required)

but then anyways it fails with:

rsync: [sender] change_dir
"/data/projects/test/build/tmp/work/cortexa53-crypto-poky-linux/nerdctl/v0.18.0-r0/nerdctl-v0.18.0/src/import/vendor.fetch/
github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3" failed: No such file or directory (2)
| rsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous errors)
(code 23) at main.c(1327) [sender=3.2.5]

And in ${BP} I cannot see any of those vendor stuff which should be
present. Is there some fix for that already pending or it's known issue?

Thanks and BR,

marek

does it work if you add do_compile[network] = "1"

Nope it is not. It turns out that the fetch phase is not correct. When I do
bitbake nerdctl -e | grep SRC_URI I got only:

 SRC_URI="git://
github.com/containerd/nerdctl.git;name=nerdcli;branch=main;protocol=https"

and not other SRC_URI's added in src_uri.inc file. It's mystery to me why
this include is not working

Khem any idea what can be the cause of this issue please? I've tried yq
recipe which using more less the same approach and there SRC_URI's are
printed properly.

OK please disregard this message. I find out I have a nerdctl bbappend
which overwrites SRC_URI permanently. BTW on kirkstone nerdctl is broken
due wrong branch name + wrong SRCREV. Should I post a patch?
