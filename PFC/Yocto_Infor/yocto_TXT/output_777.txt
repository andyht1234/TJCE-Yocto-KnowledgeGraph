Hi guys,
I really need your help in solving this issue.
I want to add nodejs to my image and added the line *IMAGE_INSTALL_append
+= " nodejs "*
to my *local.conf* file, but got the error message






*ERROR: core-image-minimal-1.0-r0 do_image_cpio: The initramfs size
171613(K) exceeds INITRAMFS_MAXSIZE: 131072(K)ERROR:
core-image-minimal-1.0-r0 do_image_cpio: You can set INITRAMFS_MAXSIZE a

Task
(/home/mohan/amlogic/poky/meta/recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal.bb:do_image_cpio)

I tried to solve this by adding the line
*INITRAMFS_MAXSIZE = "524288000"  *to my local.conf file and it compiled
successfully. But the OS flashing failed.
I have been stuck with this issue for a very long time and need your
support in this issue. I have attached all the log files or necessary files
for you to refer.

Thanks and regards,
Hassan

You didn't add log from flashing where it fails. Can you set
INITRAMFS_MAXSIZE to only 200M or so? Also from logs it looks like
you're using amlogic. Can you maybe ask for support from your vendor?

Hi Merek,
Sorry for the late reply.

I was able to build the image but the rebooting failed.
I was able to solve the issue by using command CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL_append = " nodejs nodejs-npm"; in my local.conf folder.

Though I am not completely why above line worked. Can anyone explain to me the reasoning behind it.

Thanks and Regards,
Hassan
