Hi,

Whilst we had a green QA report and were thinking rc2 would release, we
did get a user report of problems with graphics on qemu and sato was
inoperable (bug 15100).

Sadly our QA automation doesn't catch an issue like this and it mustn't
have shown on real hardware.

Due to the nature of the bug and the fact we have a fix (kernel upgrade
from 6.1.21 to 6.1.24), we're going to build an rc3. I was able to
include many of the migration guide and release note changes too.

It is build on the autobuilder at the moment. I have chosen to include
some CVE fixes and fairly critical bitbake fixes too since we are
rebuilding and they were available.

Cheers,

Richard
