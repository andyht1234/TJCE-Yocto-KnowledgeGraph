First, Zeus is *very* old: https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases says that it was end-of-life in August 2020.  Please upgrade to something newer.

Anyway, it looks like the opentelemetry collector is written in Go, so I suggest that your procedure for integrating opentelemetary is to write a recipe that uses the Go classes to build it.
