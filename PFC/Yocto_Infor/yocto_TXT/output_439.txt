Dear YOCTO Project Team,

I would like to ask about the YOCTO version. I am a beginner developer.
Now, I use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Raspberry Pi 4. Which YOCTO version is
compatible (if it has long term support, it's good!!) ?

Sincerely yours,
Natanan

Yes, you can use the "Kirkstone" version, which has indeed Long Term 
Support:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/release-process.html#long-term-support-releases

And indeed it supports Ubuntu 22.04: 
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.10/ref-manual/system-requirements.html

There are many other pieces of information in the manual!

Cheers
Michael.
