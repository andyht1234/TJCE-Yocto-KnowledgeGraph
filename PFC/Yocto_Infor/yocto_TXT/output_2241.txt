Hello All,

While bitbaking an image recipe with systemd configured in "local.conf", I am facing an error while doing do_rootfs task.

In the local.conf :

DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
#DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED += "sysvinit"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = "systemd-compat-units"

Bitbake error:
.
.
Transaction check succeeded.
Running transaction test
Error: Transaction check error:
file /sbin/telinit conflicts between attempted installs of sysvinit-2.96-r0.cortexa7t2hf_neon_vfpv4 and systemd-1:244.5-r0.cortexa7t2hf_neon_vfpv4

I was not facing this error before without systemd.

Can anyone please let me know how to resolve this error and what does this error mean?

Your help will be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance

P.S: If I uncomment DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED += "sysvinit" in local.conf I get below error:

ERROR: Nothing RPROVIDES 'sysvinit' (but [...]/core-image-swupdate.bb RDEPENDS on or otherwise requires it)
sysvinit was skipped: missing required distro feature 'sysvinit' (not in DISTRO_FEATURES)

I think core-image-swupdate.bb is adding sysvinit explicitly, please
remove it from that.

Hello Khem,

Doing "bitbake -e core-image-swupdate | grep ^INIT_MANAGER=" shows INIT_MANAGER="none". And "bitbake -e core-image-swupdate | grep ^DISTRO_FEATURES=" shows DISTRO_FEATURES="acl alsa argp bluetooth ext2 ipv4 ipv6 largefile pcmcia usbgadget usbhost wifi xattr nfs zeroconf pci 3g nfc x11 vfat largefile opengl ptest multiarch wayland vulkan systemd wifi systemd pulseaudio sysvinit gobject-introspection-data ldconfig".

I don't understand why these is both systemd and sysvinit. In the core-image-swupdate I have mentioned:

DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"

Can you please let me know how can I check if the recipe has dependency on sysvinit or not?

Thanks in advance
