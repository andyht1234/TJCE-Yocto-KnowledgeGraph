Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.5 M2 has been released.
*	YP 3.1.14 is undergoing QA aiming for release later this week
*	We plan to remove our centos8 autobuilder workers (using stream)
since there are regressions being introduced to the distro which aren't
being actively fixed quickly enough for the needs of the autobuilder (e.g.
the ability of normal users to use ping). We can't really recommend this as
a build distro for that reason. The alma8 workers are looking more stable
and will remain.
*	We are seeing a potential hang issue with make 4.2.1 where kernel or
perl builds hang (seen on stream and opensuse 15.3), help/insight in
debugging that would be very welcome.
*	Prelink support was removed from master due to it's planned removal
from glibc 2.36.
*	The glibc 2.35 upgrade is blocked on resolving a couple of issues,
one test failing using buildtools and another in multilib builds having
overlapping files.
*	A new Patchwork is available at
<https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/> https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/.
This new system is running the up to date mainline code and will receive
regular updates. The previous unmaintained fork remains up at
<https://patchwork.openembedded.org/> https://patchwork.openembedded.org/ to
preserve history. We are seeking help updating PatchTest to run with the new
version.

Everyone can now sign up for an account on the new system. Patchwork project
maintainers please email  <mailto:mhalstead@linuxfoundation.org>
mhalstead@linuxfoundation.org to have your access restored.

*	Intermittent issues continue to be at record high levels and help is
very much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

In particular, we're struggling to understand the intermittent network issue
with external hosts we're seeing very occasionally.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help us resolve CVE issues:
