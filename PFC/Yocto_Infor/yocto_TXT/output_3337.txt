I am following steps mentioned below link to create Kernel and u-boot for AM335x starter kit

http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-linux/esd/docs/latest/linux/Overview_Building_the_SDK.html
Its building correctly.

Now I am using the meta-webos-master layer which has sqlcipher to be addedto the Linux kernel, I am getting errrors durig the build itself
The error is as below
========================
/AM335x/prj/tisdk/build$ MACHINE=am335x-evm bitbake arago-base-tisdk-image
