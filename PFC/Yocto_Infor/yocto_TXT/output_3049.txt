Hi,

Please correct me, but I think the system environment set up in Yocto
Linux may not be the same as other distributions. I have a shell
script to set up export PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, I want to avoid
putting full path in ExecStart and all of my shell scripts

ExecStart=my_measurement.sh

I have been thinking of the following options, but I am not sure which
one works, if the syntax is correct or not, which one is the best for
common practice, appreciate your advice.

(1) Setup in all systemd service scripts

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/usr/bin/my_export.sh
ExecStart=my_measurement.sh

Is the syntax above statements in service scripts correct? Will it work?

(2) Add my_export.sh to /etc/profile.d

That one works for Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS, will all Yocto systemd
service scripts pick up environment setup from /etc/profile.d
automatically in Yocto Linux distribution?

(3) Add my_export.sh to /etc/default

Some distributions automatically pick setup from /etc/default, does it
work for Yocto Linux for systemd service scripts to pick up
my_export.sh setup from /etc/default?

Thank  you.

Kind regards,
