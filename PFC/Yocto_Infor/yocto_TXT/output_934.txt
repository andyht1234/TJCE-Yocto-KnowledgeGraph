Hi community,

I look for the resize2fs recipes.  This application shall be included in the e2fsprog package but it's not there.  I've also tried to configure the e2fsprog package using menuconfig without any success (bitbake -c menuconfig e2fsprog).

Normally I use https://layers.openembedded.org to find the recipes for required packages but this time, everything points me to the e2fsprog recipes but it doesn't work for me.

Any idea and another system to find which meta-* provides a specific application?

Thank you, team,

Have a nice day

Martin

Hi,
you need to install 'e2fsprogs-resize2fs'

Martin

you can use a tool called oe-pkgdata-util to operate on metadata for
such things e.g.

oe-pkgdata-util find-path "*resize2fs"

would give you the names of output packages containing this binary
