Hi Amahnui,

We're making progress in the right direction :)

This is still not a valid path for the yocto-autobuilder-helper git 
repo. It should say scripts/docs_fix_all_html_css.py and 
scripts/run-docs-build (do not modify it by hand :) ).

See for yourself:
https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-autobuilder-helper/tree/
This is the root of the directory, where your patch would be applied. 
You can see that no run-docs-build file exists there so your patch will 
not work.

However, in 
https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-autobuilder-helper/tree/scripts, the 
scripts directory, does have a run-docs-build script so your patch would 
apply nicely there.

Would you mind telling us how you created your patch from a commit so we 
can help you fix the issue there?

A simple test to do to check if your patch can be applied is to try to 
apply it yourself.

Provided you have your patch file (the one you sent with git 
send-email!) named my.patch and located in /path/to/, run:

git clone https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-autobuilder-helper
cd https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-autobuilder-helper
git am /path/to/my.patch

If it works, all good!
If it does not, something needs to be fixed.

I'm not sure how picky we want to be, but I imagine we want anything 
that is not dunfell (so anything not from 3.1.x release) to display that 
it is obsolete and the user should consider upgrading to a newer release.
For dunfell, the message above is fine (because dunfell is still 
supported, and all other releases in those old docs aren't anymore).

This used to modify only style.css but now it tries to modify all css 
files. Did you test this version of the script? Are you sure it does not 
break other css files?

Cheers,
Quentin

I'm sorry I added the run-docs-build manually to another folder after testing it so that I could easily track it, I did not send the patch from the script/run-docs-build and script/docs_fix_all_html_css.py directory, but I had it run from there, the thing is I had made many commits which I felt will not be included in the latest patch, so I initialized a new folder so I can easily hard reset it. But I could send a patch that takes into consideration the actual path from which I tested the script.

Yes actually I don't think break the other css files as I have check and all the other css files end with style.css, but I will replace it with style.css just in case I missed a file that ends with .css but is not style.css

Hi Quentin,
I'm sorry for taking so long
I'm still trying to figure out how to prevent the script from writing into the 3.1 versions and above.
