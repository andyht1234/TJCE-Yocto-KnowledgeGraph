Key Status/Updates:

   -

   Next week M2 is due to build so if anyone has changes for that
   milestone, please send ASAP.
   -

   YP 4.0.2 has been through QA and is likely to be released in the next
   few days.
   -

   A reproducibility issue was identified and raised a question on whether
   we could enable               an old QA check for these kinds of issues
   (‘buildpaths’ in insane.bbclass). Some bugs were fixed in the test but is
   has highlighted several reproducibility issues. Some have been fixed but
   others remain:
   -

      docs issues in lib32-vala, rpm, lib32-gtk-doc, vala, gtk-doc
      -

      musl issue in ltp
      -

      multilib issues in lib32-vala, vala, rpm (may overlap docs)
      -

      qemuarm64 kernel-devsrc issue (Bruce looking into)
      -

      meta-virt issues in xen-tools (Christopher looking into)
      -

      meta-gplv2 issues in mc, tar
      -

      lttng-modules .debug issue on beaglebone, edgerouter, and qemumips
      -

   Fixing these will allow us to enable buildpaths by default which should
   allow more people to spot reproducibility issues.
   -

   There is a discussion about layer setup tooling in the bitbake-layers
   discussion on the OE-Core list, input is welcome from those with an
   interest in this.
   -

   There is also a RFC series about improving the eSDK tooling workflows
   from Alex Kanavin which may be of interest.
   -

   Code to monitor the /proc/pressure interface has been added and there is
   a patch to optionally allow bitbake to reduce the number of processes
   running depending on system load, which it is hoped may help some of our
   autobuilder intermittent issues (thanks Aryaman and Randy).
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT


Ways to contribute:

   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
