Hi all,

I`m trying to debug coredump generated on embedded system running dunfel. The issue I`m facing is with the source files path in "-dbg.rootfs" archive and within dedug portion of a package.
When loaded in QtCreator some sources can`t be found :

The part is missing is " *build/..* ". Such notation is obviosly cancels itself and adding empty "build" folder manually helps.
This path allings with how it builds. Here is a part of Makefile found in build path for sqlite:

build/Makefile:20:VPATH = ../sqlite-autoconf-3310100
build/Makefile:313:abs_srcdir = /home/bohdan/noah/noah/tmp/work/cortexa8hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/sqlite3/3_3.31.1-r0/build/../sqlite-autoconf-3310100
build/Makefile:315:abs_top_srcdir = /home/bohdan/noah/noah/tmp/work/cortexa8hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/sqlite3/3_3.31.1-r0/build/../sqlite-autoconf-3310100
build/Makefile:358:srcdir = ../sqlite-autoconf-3310100

So I tried to disable out-of-tree build for sqlite by replacing *'inherit autotools* ' with ' *inherit autotools-brokensep* '. After building and loading new debugfs QtCreator was able to found required sources:

Is this a known issue or me doing something wrong with build setup?

Hi,

I`m trying to debug without connection to target at all. This are the examples of what I`m running:

# gdb-multiarch b2010_rootfs/usr/bin/noah-heatsystem var/volatile/crash/core.noah.565
(gdb) set sysroot b2010_rootfs/
(gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src/debug b2010/usr/src/debug
.... things are getting loaded .....

(gdb) bt
#0  0xb4a6a144 in saveCursorsOnList (p=0xccf34862, iRoot=3, pExcept=0xb540b350) at ../sqlite-autoconf-3310100/sqlite3.c:64883
.... more frames here .....

And this how it looks like when out of tree build disabled:

# gdb-multiarch b2010_rootfs/usr/bin/noah-heatsystem var/volatile/crash/core.noah.565
(gdb) set sysroot src_add_rootfs/
(gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src/debug src_add_rootfs/usr/src/debug
.... things are getting loaded .....

(gdb) bt
#0  0xb4a6a144 in saveCursorsOnList (p=0xccf34862, iRoot=3, pExcept=0xb540b350) at sqlite3.c:64883
.... more frames here .....

In a  first case `layout next` command shows that no source code can be found and in a second case source code is shown.

Best regards,

Bohdan.

Hi,

I can see this on Qt builds as well. I doubt Qt can have such strange behavior left unnoticed for a long time. The part is missing is " *include/QtCore* "
