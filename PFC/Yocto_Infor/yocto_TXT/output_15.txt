There was one failure in the build, a serial login issue on ttyS1, so
an occurrence of our annoying 6.5 issue. This is the first time we've
seen it with the workaround applied.

The question is to proceed with rc1 in testing, or apply the upstream
fixes and try an rc2 with that? I'm torn...

Cheers,

Richard

I’d say we should proceed with RC1 whilst testing upstream fixes.

If they manage to shake out all of the failures then we can decide whether to spin another RC with the fixes in, or just release with what with have - with copious release notes obviously.

Lets run with this approach, I agree. I am running test builds in the
background and we'll see how reliable the upstream fix is. I think
moving forward with rc1 as is makes sense.

Hello,

The regression report looks worryingly empty. It has been generated with
yocto-4.2 as comparison base. When taking a look at yocto-testresults content
for it, I only find a few test results (11, while it should be something around
300). I am not sure yet if we did some mistakes while re-uploading manually
missing tests results during the 4.2 cycle, or if tests results are indeed
suffering some issues for release builds (this is repeatable on different 4.2.x
releases).

So in the mean time, here is a manual regression report between 4.3_M3 and
yocto-4.3.rc1:

https://pastebin.com/6QbfGstR

The report has a "rate limit" applied for noisy regression (patch incoming)

Kind regards,
Alexis

Thanks for that, much appreciated.

I just skimmed your report and have some feedback to hopefully make it easier to read in the future.

I’d suggest sorting the output in order of importance.  For example, this is a section that I really don’t care about:

Match:       sdk_core-image-sato_x86_64_fvp-base_20230910083055
             sdk_core-image-sato_x86_64_fvp-base_20231017222150

Put those at the bottom, or even better collate them into a single section where there have been no changes.

Similarly:

Match:       runtime_core-image-sato_qemux86_20230911011430
             runtime_core-image-sato_qemux86_20231017223736
    Additionally, 1 new test(s) is/are present

I guess marginally more important than identical results, but “there are new tests that passed” isn’t very interesting.

Now on to the regressions.

Regression: oeselftest_ubuntu-22.04_qemux86-64_20230911011940
    oeselftest_almalinux-9.2_qemux86-64_20231017221342

Should they have matched? The host distro doesn’t match and this matters for some of the tests, as some distros don’t support some of the selftests. In this case specifically, there are seven regressions and six of them are specific to the host changing, which has the side-effect of hiding the one actual regression.

The report then lists the first however many regressions before announcing the summary:

 (In total, 7134 regressions/status changes detected)
    Additionally, 7 previously failing test(s) is/are now passing
    Additionally, 4622 new test(s) is/are present
 
The headline figure of 7134 regressions should be first, as that’s the most important data point in a skim of the report.  List the summary first, and then the breakdown.

Grouping the results would be interesting, because the list got truncated I can’t see easily if all 7134 regressions were in ptestresult.gcc-g++-user.* or if that was just the first 100 and the rest were other components.  Breaking the ptest results up by the second level component would be interesting, if it said something like this then we’d be able to get a feel for what components have broken from the report.

7134 regressions detected.
    ptestresult.gcc-libstdc++-v3-user.30_threads/thread/native_handle/cancel.cc execution test: PASS -> FAIL
    [ say 10 results per component ]
    And 6123 more in ptestresult.gcc-libstdc++v3
    ptestresult.gcc-libgomp.libgomp.c++/ctor-10.C: UNSUPPORTED -> UNRESOLVED


This one also caught my eye:
Regression:  runtime_core-image-sato_qemuppc_20230910082140
             runtime_core-image-sato_qemuppc_20231017222112
    systemd.SystemdJournalTests.test_systemd_boot_time: PASSED -> SKIPPED
    Additionally, 1 new test(s) is/are present

Is that comparing a systemd test run with a sysvinit test run?

Thanks for the work on the tool so far, this is a lot easier to read than the full reports!

I'd noticed that too, not sure what happened but it wasn't what I'd
expected. It would be good to understand what went wrong.

I was thinking about ideas like printing the regressions first, then
the matches. I think Ross has some good feedback about how we can
improve things.

Cheers,

Richard

Indeed, not so useful and hiding the real content at the bottom

Yeah, that's a point I have been struggling with when starting to update those
tools. The initial assumption I have started working with, after discussing the
matter with Richard (see [1]), is the following:
1. MACHINE _must_ match between base and target
2. Different HOSTS _can_ be cross-checked

But the issue you are pointing tends to show it does not work well in some
cases. I will have to do some tests to see if dropping 2. reduce this noise
without loosing valuable data, or if we need to find something smarter

Makes sense. I have posted this morning the series introducing the display limit
([2]), I can work on a v2 implementing the ptest specific display limit

I think the comparison is relevant, both are bout systemd system (many systemd
tests are present and OK in runtime_core-image-sato_qemuppc_20231017222112
results). However I do not get why it is marked as skipped and not failed:

            "systemd.SystemdJournalTests.test_systemd_boot_time": {
                "duration": 2.3783957958221436,
                "log": "Error when parsing time from boot string",
                "status": "SKIPPED"
            }

Maybe an issue in the corresponding runner ?

What the autobuilder does is either runs one selftest on a random host
for q-quick, or for a-full it will run five selftests, one for
"centos", one for "arm", one for "ubuntu", one for "fedora" and one for
"debian".

Ideally we'd therefore compare debian to debian if we have any choice.
It is a question of finding the closest matches. That is hard in code
though whilst keeping it generic.

Cheers,

Richard

We've realised there is a nasty bug in rc1 related to patchtest
deleting local changes. Given the build failure in the rc1 build and
other security issues we're thinking we should make an rc2 build and
abandon rc1.

Sorry for the churn. The new build should be ready soon with any luck.

Cheers,

Richard
