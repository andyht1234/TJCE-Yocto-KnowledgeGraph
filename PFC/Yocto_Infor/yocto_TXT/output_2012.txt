Hello,
I've been playing around building a Yocto imagine based on kirkstone/master
on the just released Fedora 36 beta test image. (just to give a few bits
more details: builds a MX8X image, works perfectly fine with Fedora 34 and
35 since quite some time)

The first and most obvious thing I've found out is that it is based on a
newer version of glibcxx (3.4.30) when the very latest uninative available
(as far as I could see, apologies if I'm wrong) is on 3.4.29, so at some
point this will break the build (when pzstd is called).

Of course for the time being I just disabled uninative and the build is
going on (will report of course should I find something else). I'm not sure
(still checking this) if that should have happened automatically, but there
was actually no warning in that sense (maybe because is GLIBCXX and not
GLIBC itself?)
But the question is: should I try to contribute that tarball (I will search
for details, but if there is any good reference more than welcome!) or is
it something that is likely done by the core team?

Of course FC36 is still a test distro so there is no surprise it broke, but
as we are close to Kirkstone release and possibly other distros will get
the same upgrade, I guess it could be great if we may fix this before that
deadline.

Many thanks!
Federico

Thanks for reporting it. I think to generate the newer version we need gcc 12
which is still in pre-release. We generate the uninative tarball using our own
builds on the autobuilder so until we have gcc 12 recipes there, we can't
generate that.

Once gcc 12 is out, we will release a new uninative (assuming we can update our
recipes).

I'd like to think the checks in uninative would have noticed the mismatch, we do
have some code there to detect libc version but perhaps not the CXX pieces so
I'd welcome help in adding something for that.

Cheers,

Richard

FWIW: the same is happening now with ubuntu-22.04 where libstdc++6 package
is now built from gcc-12 sources (even when gcc itself still defaults to
gcc-11).

I was trying to add the check in uninative.bbclass, but haven't found easy
portable way to detect the version from libstdc++.so.6 (other than parsing
objdump -x /full/path/to/libstdc++.so.6 output).

Hello,
Thanks for the feedback!

Indeed the check is only on the "ldd --version" output which doesn't
account for the libstdc++ and that explains it. As compared to Ubuntu
22.04, Fedora 36 actually has also GCC 12.0.1 as default compiler.

As Martin mentions not sure if there is an easy portable way. He mentions
objdump which is for sure effective but maybe complicated and I feel like
relies on the filename being guessed (well should be known, the main link
at least) and feels a bit overcomplicated (if we need to go that low level
in case I'd suggest just to just use "strings" and grep there instead).

Would relying just on the filename be too shaky? I can see here
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/abi.html in point 3 of
"History" that it would seem quite well defined. Actually I guess if we
would just compare the system libstdc++.so.X.Y.Z (which we may be easily
able to get it from the libstdc++.so link) to uninative one  maybe would be
enough to determine it is newer? Hardcoding the path to libstdc++.so (as
ie. /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so) is probably not nice (ie. for custom
toolchains), so maybe we can ask g++ (-print-search-dirs, libraries
section) and look in those?
Then not sure if there are some distros/installs that do the insane-isy
thing of just installing directly the .so stripping the versions from the
name, hopefully not.

I'm not sure using anything from g++ -dumpspecs would be viable if as
Martin mentions you may have (ie. ubuntu-2204) a version with new stdc++
but older g++.

Cheers,
Federico
