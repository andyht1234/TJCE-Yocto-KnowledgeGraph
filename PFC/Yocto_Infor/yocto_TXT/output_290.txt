Hi, I was reading this very old mailing list post about SSTATE and cache
hits.

https://www.openembedded.org/pipermail/openembedded-core/2014-June/211563.html

Is the information in that message still accurate?  Are there any newer
tools available to help understand why a recipe got a cache miss?
Thanks.

The basics haven't changed and bitbake-diffsigs is still the tool which
can compare two sig files.

The basic idea is to take the siginfo file for the recipe that missed
(from the stamps directory) and compared it to the one you think should
have matched from sstate.

Cheers,

Richard
