Hello Developers,

We are migrating our platforms from Zeus to Gatesgarth, We could see that
the native Python2 bb file and core modules have been removed.

 As much of our platform code is in Python2, I was wondering if there is
some way we can re-enable python2 support in our yocto environment to
compile/run python2 scripts ?

Thanks in Advance,

Thanks & Regards
Aashik
