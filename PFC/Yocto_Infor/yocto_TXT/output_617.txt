Random errors can occur when bazel is taken from sstate-cache and the
dynamic loader is no longer available. Setting DYNAMIC_LOADER and
letting populate_sysroot_setscene modify the UNINATIVE_LOADER is not
enough. That way we just modify the loader of bazel binary, but bazel is
also a self-extracting zip file with built-in binaries that need
dynamic loader modification to work.

Eample error, as you can see it's quite misleading:
| An error occurred during the fetch of repository 'local_config_cuda'
| Cuda Configuration Error: Invalid cpu_value
| Skipping 'tensorflow/lite/tools/benchmark:benchmark_model': no such package '@local_config_cuda//cuda

To fix this in do_configure execute bazel version to unpack
output_user_root and run patchelf-uninative on the ELF executables. Then
change modification time to some future date so that bazel does not see
the modification.

Hi Hongxu,
I can see you disabled the uninative back in the bazel-native recipe. Can
you please provide steps to reproduce the "bazel/bazel.real: Input/output
error" so we could investigate why it happens? Disabling uninative will
cause the failure if bazel is taken from sstate-cache.

Best regards,
Tomasz Dziendzielski

It is not reproducible always, but be reproducible on specific build 
host, it seems gcc tool chain or libc related I guess
