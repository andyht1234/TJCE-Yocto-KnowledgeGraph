Hello,

I'm trying to put together a recipe where I conditionally install files depending on the image locale. I can see from the reference manual that Yocto will use the contents of IMAGE_LINGUAS to install locales during the root filesystem construction process. How can I go about creating locales for my custom packages/recipes?

You might consider creating a custom task in your recipe where you can
handle your unique requirements.
