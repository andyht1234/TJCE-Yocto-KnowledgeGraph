There is a new PACKAGECONFIG for grpc to allows us
to selectively enable/disable shared builds.

This is good, thanks. Is the libnsl2 also tied to some feature? Perhaps 
you can explain why it needs to be removed from MinGW

My research says libnsl is a soft requirement for c-ares.
GRPC assumes libnsl to be present and used by default.
However, it will build without it too.

https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/basicnet/libnsl.html

We should be turning libnsl off if you want to enable GRPC's backward
compatibility mode. Maybe, because previous versions didn't support
libnsl.


c-ares
-------------
CMakeLists.txt:CARES_FUNCTION_IN_LIBRARY (gethostbyname nsl HAVE_LIBNSL)
CMakeLists.txt: LIST (APPEND CARES_DEPENDENT_LIBS nsl)


grpc
-------------
  if(gRPC_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE)
    # See https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/17255
    set(HAVE_LIBNSL OFF CACHE BOOL "avoid cares dependency on libnsl")
  endif()

CMakeLists.txt:option(gRPC_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE "Build libraries
that are binary compatible across a larger number of OS and libc
versions" OFF)
CMakeLists.txt:if(gRPC_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE)
