Current Dev Position: YP 4.1 M3 (Feature Freeze)

Next Deadline: 22nd August 2022 YP 4.1 M3 Build

 

Next Team Meetings:

*	Bug Triage meeting Thursday September 1st 7:30 am PDT (
<https://zoom.us/j/454367603?pwd=ZGxoa2ZXL3FkM3Y0bFd5aVpHVVZ6dz09>
https://zoom.us/j/454367603?pwd=ZGxoa2ZXL3FkM3Y0bFd5aVpHVVZ6dz09)
*	Weekly Project Engineering Sync Tuesday August  30th at 8 am PDT (

*	Twitch -  See  <https://www.twitch.tv/theyoctojester>
https://www.twitch.tv/theyoctojester

 

Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.1.19 was released
*	We are now at feature freeze for 4.1 but M3 has not been built yet.
*	We are trying to prepare for the M3 build but the status of too many
issues remains uncertain. In particular:

*	llvm buildpaths patch was requested to be rewritten and the rewrite
doesn't work
*	rust ppc patch was deemed incorrect
*	layer setup changes didn't test successfully
*	rust SDK relocation patch is still in progress
*	concerns were raised over the rust crossbeam-utils atomics
workaround

*	In addition, several other high priority (release blocking) bugs
were identified in bug triage, particularly issues which are occurring
intermittently but regularly and hence causing failed builds. Richard and
Ross own the majority but can't handle all these at once and rather
depressingly, there was nobody to take ownership of some of them. The
current list of open high bugs:

o    perl builds hanging indefinitely:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14902>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14902

o    cve checking crashing intermittently with database issues:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14899>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14899

o    ptest in gcrypt intermittently but regularly failing on arm:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14800>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14800

o    build path corruption when llvm is used to build mesa:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14897>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14897

o    ptest infrastructure issue which stops us debugging an intermittent
failure in lttng:  <https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14901>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14901

o    intermittent rust SDK host library corruption:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14892>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14892

o    no automated mechanism to compare releases for ptest regressions:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14897>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14897

*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:

mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.

The latest patchset has no known issues.

I will look into this. Findings will go into the ticket.

I think I may be lagging a little behind on status. I did see a lot of
confusion about the patches and I know they didn't make the last
testing cut. Hopefully they'll be in the next patch.

Thanks! We haven't quite found the exact trigger to reproduce it but it
seems related to rebuilds somehow.

Cheers,

Richard

Yes, this usually happens when new patches from master get pulled in
and perl is rebuilding on top of a previous build. It then cleans its
own directory in a way that results in timestamps aligning just so,
that make gets lost in its own rules, and enters an infinite loop.
I've seen this locally several times, and have the 'wrong' tree saved,
but I also don't know how to trigger the arrival at the wrong tree
reliably.

I suspect this patch may be the solution:

I just resent the complete patchset (across three mailing lists -
this/bitbake/poky). It's a bit tricky for testers working from
poky-contrib, as they need a poky based set, but this is for
individual repos and master-next.
