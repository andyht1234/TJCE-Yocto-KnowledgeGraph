Its sunny, it is summer, you're just back from vacation? Nothing better to
get into the flow again than writing a proposal for the 2023.11 edition of
the Yocto Project Summit!

We love to hear about all your Yocto things. What you made, what you broke,
what you learned, what you created.

The CFP is open now at https://pretalx.com/yocto-project-summit-2023-11/cfp

Josef on behalf of the YPS organization team
