Hello,

I have a generic use-case of maintaining the meta layer. I have a custom meta layer. But this layer serves multiple customers who share most of the recipes and files. But some files are customer-specific. Currently, I am using different repos and tags in gitlab but regularly updating them is tedious and time-consuming. Rather I am think to create to create a generic meta layer and use Yocto features/variables (if existing) to maintain different versions. For example, a recipe test.bb has FILES_${PN} += " /lib/systemd/system/test.service \ "
But the contents of "test.service" is customer-specific and different versions has to be maintained. So, is there any way to make this generic? Can this be done using .bbappend files?

I assume this might be the use case of many people..

Thanks in advance

Few things comes to mind. You could deploy the systemd unit fragment strategy
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd#Drop-in_files
so any customizations you have could be done via these drop-ins and
keeping common service file
these drops can be then controlled via customer distro specific
override in your main bb itself.

Second, way would be to have test.service copies installed under
files/<customer-override>/ directory next to recipe
and then define customer distro specific overrides

Hello Khem Raj,

Thank you for the response.

This seems to be a better solution for my use case. But, I didn't understand it completely. Could you please provide an example or any link to documentation? Is it also needed to create a custom distribution? This layer will be used by different customers in bblayers.conf

see how xorg.conf is defined for different qemu based machines in
xserver-xf86-config recipe [1]
