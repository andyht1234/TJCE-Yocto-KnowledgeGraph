I see the following two items on the page of 2022 Yocto Project Weekly Status Archive:
1. A tool, used for collaboration on the creation of release notes, git-refinery-web has been made publicly available by Intel, thanks! We may not be able to use it for 4.1 due to the timescales but the hope is to use it in the future for collaboratively creating the release notes.
2. Thinking about the idea of variable “filter” functions to help implementation of recipe class extensions (like native and nativesdk).

Where can I find relevant content about "variable filter function" and "git-refinery-web"?

You can find the code here:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/git-refinery-web/

We've had a few issues deploying an instance of it unfortunately.

There are some examples of filter functions here:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky-contrib/log/?h=jpew/bb-filters

It is very much a work in progress idea.

Cheers,

Richard
