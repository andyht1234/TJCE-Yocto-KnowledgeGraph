Has anyone added this to a yocto build?
I am sure it is possible but cant find any info, maybe someone has done it

Layerindex is the place to search for packages and recipes.
Sadly aptly isn't found from there:

https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/recipes/?q=aptly

Note that packages (rpm, ipk, deb, tar) and their repositories are used to build
images but other use cases like updating packages on older images/installations
from a package stream are not so frequently used and may be buggy.

Cheers,

-Mikko
