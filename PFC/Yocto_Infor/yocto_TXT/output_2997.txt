I'd like to use a systemd DHCP client feature that became available in v248
in my yocto-hardknott system.  Is there any hope of using the complete
v249.1 recipe from the oe master branch?

To backport a newer version, I usually just take the trial and error
route by copying the recipe to a custom layer and then, if necessary,
resolving missing or outdated dependencies on the go. This works most
of the time, but it could get a bit more complicated for systemd if
something fundamentally changed.

Thanks Nicolas.

I was able to get what I needed by backporting the relevant changes (DHCP
client LinkLocal address fallback) into the systemd v247 source.  It was a
little ugly, but is working now.

I was afraid to try the full systemd v249.
