Hi,

Given the high profile of iwd and advocating connman with iwd, I
believe someone have already built Yocto connman and iwd,
surprisingly, I could not even find an iwd recipe in
https://github.com/openembedded/openembedded/tree/master/recipes, nor
can I find connman document and instructions to replace wpa_supplicant
by iwd, what could I be missing here?

Appreciate your kind advice.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

- jh

Please look at the layer index for recipes:
https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/layers/

I don’t have any advice for building it however.

I forgot to include the recipe link:

Thanks Tim for the link, I have built the iwd.

According to Daniel's advice to configure with "--disable-wifi,
--enable-iwd", I added PACKAGECONFIG[wifi] = "--disable-wifi,
--enable-iwd", to override PACKAGECONFIG[wifi] in oe-core
connman_1.40.bb. The intention is to remove wpa-supplicant and to add
iwd to connman_1.40.bbappend, it built the image without error, I
believe that the syntax is OK, but the wpa-supplicant was still built
and packaged. Any idea from OE/Yocto insiders why PACKAGECONFIG[wifi]
in bbappend is not effective?

Daniel, how can I verify in the Linux console if the connmand is
running with iwd or with wpa_supplicant? I have disabled
wpa_supplicant.service, and I'll remove wpa_supplicant completely when
I find a way to do it.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

- jh

Hi,

Please correct me, but it seems to me the connman is moving to a
direction to ditch out wpa_supplicant and to use iwd, but the Honister
still configure connman with wpa_supplicant by default, appreciate
your advice:

- Is connman with iwd stable enough?

- How can I create a connman_1.40.bbappend  to replace wpa_supplicant
by iwd configure?

- Where are the documents for configuring and building connman with
iwd? Where is the operational guidance to run connman with iwd? Can I
use the same connman dbus APIs or are there any dbus API changes to
run connman with iwd?

My apology for FAQs.

Thank you very much.

Kind regards,

- JH
