Anyone successfully building using Rootless Podman?

I'm seeing a variety of strange issues.

My baseline podman config:
--user 1001:1001
--ipc host
--privileged
--security-opt label=disable
--pid host
--userns keep-id
--ulimit host
--mount type=devpts,destination=/dev/pts
--security-opt label=disable
--group-add keep-groups

We have tried it hard in yoe distro but it always fails in novel ways so
much. I have switched back to docker for now

Does anyone know what ways it is failing (or how I can duplicate it ) and I
can forward to the podman group (can't promise I can get it fixed.. but
will do what I can). Also if people have already opened issues on the
failures, let me know.

Assuming we are talking about a meta-virtualization built podman, and
a yocto image,
this would be more appropriate on the meta-virtualization mailing list

That being said, I do test rootless podman each release, and during
updates to the
package (I have a medium term TODO to automate that), and I was able to just
run a simple rootless podman test on master.

But rootless anything isn't a simple question. What release are we
talking about ?
What kernel ? What architecture, and what is the container image and commands
that are being run ?

HAH! Not enough coffee today.

Never mind, I completely read over the word BUILDING!!!

At least this motivated me to test our on-target rootless podman again.

With yoe

local.sh
export DOCKER_REPO=yoedistro/yoe-build:bookworm-`uname -m`
export DOCKER=podman

and then try to build yoe-simple-image, it complains about enough
parallel threads not being available when running node to build
qtwebengine
omp running out of threads in other recipes and so on. These issues
don't happen on native or docker builds e.g. privileged mode also does
show these issues.

Hello,

I'm using rootless podman to build with this container:
https://github.com/tprrt/dockers/tree/master/debian-oe

Kind regards,
Thomas Perrot

Hi,

I, too, am using rootless podman on Fedora 38 (and 36 and 37 in the past).

I use kas container for building:

podman run -it --rm --userns=keep-id -e USER_ID=$UID -e GROUP_ID=$GID -v 
~/work/yocto/sstate-cache:$HOME/work/yocto/sstate-cache -v 
~/work/yocto/downloads/:$HOME/work/yocto/downloads -w $PWD -v 
"$PWD":"$PWD" -v "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK":"$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK 
--security-opt label=disable --tmpfs /tmp ghcr.io/siemens/kas/kas:3.1 shell

You may want to not disable security labels and do it properly though :)

--tmpfs /tmp was essential. I don't remember the exact issue but this 
was raised in a GitHub issue by Trevor Woerner (added in Cc). I found 
this discussion in kas Google groups talking a bit more in-depth about 
this very topic: 
https://groups.google.com/g/kas-devel/c/Dm3OcBS-yao/m/u5CV9JrVAgAJ. See 
some other discussion here: 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/5A44F13B-F383-449C-8FB9-87BEBEF1272D@0leil.net/T/#m381e450b92ac0a313be522600bbaa14a50b1fa78

For some of our debian (bullseye) based servers with many cores, we had 
to modify the pids_limit for podman too.

In /etc/containers/containers.conf, have:
pids_limit = 1000000

I was convinced I modified some wiki to list this somewhere but the 
search bar didn't return anything unfortunately :/

Cheers,
Quentin
