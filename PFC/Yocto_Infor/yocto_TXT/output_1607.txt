The examples are not separately buildable, and not installed. So there
is currently no way to make a sperate ${PN}-examples.
We don't need the examples now, but we are interested to know what you think.

Thanks for the speedy review.

This revision does not build with musl/clang atleast since there is a
shadowing of a macro going on. You need to avoid that
I cooked a quick patch here

You might want to take a look.
