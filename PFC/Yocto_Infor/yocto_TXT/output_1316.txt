Key Status/Updates:

*	 <mailto:richard.purdie@linuxfoundation.org> Richard Purdie is
actually on holiday and expects to return on the 24th October.
*	Patches for master are welcome on the mailing list and will be
reviewed/tested, but will not be merged until RP has returned.
*	YP 4.1 rc2 is now out of QA and will be reviewed by the TSC later
today. Release is scheduled for the 28th but may happen earlier if the
documentation is finalized.
*	A bug related to the Extensible SDK has been found in YP 4.1 but
this is potentially not a release blocker, and can be fixed in the first
point release.
*	Steve Sakoman to maintain Langdale (YP 4.1 - not an LTS)
*	At release we released the core layer was still advertising
kirkstone so this was removed. This did mean some simple changes were needed
to layers to mark compatibility with the new release, we'll aim to do this
earlier in the next release.
*	YP 3.1.20 rc2 has been built and is in QA now.
*	YP 4.2 Proposed Timeline document is at:

*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT. In
particular there is a long-standing qemuppc failure which needs
investigating ( <https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14824>

help facilitate this.
