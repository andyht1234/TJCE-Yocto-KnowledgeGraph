Hello, community,

I've developing an application that uses curl using SFTP to transfer data. The first time I cross-compiled my application and and tested it, it would
print this message: "Protocol sftp not supported or disabled in libcurl".
The solution used was to add the libssh2 parameter in the curl recipe by changing the line:
    DEPENDS = "zlib gnutls"
To this:
    DEPENDS = "zlib gnutls libssh2"


I can't find any recent posts on this topic in the community. Is there a more effective/better solution? Does anyone have a different solution?

Thanks for the attention,
Daniel Mendes

The curl recipe has a PACKAGECONFIG for libssh2:

PACKAGECONFIG[libssh2] = "--with-libssh2,--without-libssh2,libssh2”

So the idiomatic way would be to enable the libssh2 PACKAGECONFIG for curl.  This is covered in the documentation: https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html?#term-PACKAGECONFIG

Thanks for the fast reply, Ross.

Yes, in the same line of thought I also managed to enable the SFTP protocol through PACKAGECONFIG. My question was also to clarify if there was any other method or try to understand why it doesn't have that option set from the start.

Anyway, with the link provided I can now understand and solve the problem. Thank you for that.

Thank you for your attention,

Daniel Mendes

Re-adding the list.

It’s not enabled by default because curl has a *huge* number of optional dependencies, and a judgement call was made.  Luckily it’s trivial to turn on. :)
