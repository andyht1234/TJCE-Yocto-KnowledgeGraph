Revert the patch resolving a file change notitfication issue (for IMA
appraisal) since this patch fails in 'many downstream kernels'.

Drop the kernel config option CONFIG_SQUASHFS_XATTR=y from ima.cfg.
Instead, require projects that use squashfs to set this option.

Unfortunately this is not enough because in the full patchset you are
overriding the do_configure task
on meta-integrity/recipes-kernel/linux/linux_ima.inc and this file is
included in every recipe that follies the
pattern starting by linux- (recipes-kernel/linux/linux-%.bbappend).

This breaks many recipes like linux-firmware and maybe others.
The root cause of the issue is now on f4f7624d2e but because this patch is
too evasive, maybe everything has to be reversed.
I am now building with the full patchset revert and so far the build is
looking good.

Jose

You are referring tho this here?

do_configure() {
     sed -i "s|^CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=.*|CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=\"${IMA_EVM_ROOT_CA}\"|" .config
}

You are saying that this deactivates some other do_configure's ? If this is the case, what would be the right syntax to fix it?


It's a no-op on a .config that does not contain the CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS= option already.=

Jose, is the correct syntax to use do_configure:append () ? Can you try with this syntax?

Yes, this is the problem. The right fix IMHO is reverting because we can't
assume that the .config it's always there
on the bitbake build directory and this only happens when building the
kernel.

Another no less significant side effect is that this change is also applied
to a wide range of recipes,
anyone starting with the name linux-*.bb.

So the full patch set should be reverted in my opinion and be more tested
locally, building for example
some recipe that respects the pattern linux-*.bb and also other kernels and
re-submitted again.

I had to deal with the need for a similarly broad bbappend, and both
distro / kernel version
conditions in meta-virtualization.

This isn't exactly what Stefan is looking for, but it is a starting point:

I suppose it only included linux_ima.inc since 'integrity' was set in DISTRO_FEATURES.

$ cat meta-security/meta-integrity/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-%.bbappend
require ${@bb.utils.contains_any('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'integrity ', 'linux_ima.inc', '', d)}


I modified the linux_ima.inc to look like this here now:


$ cat meta-security/meta-integrity/recipes-kernel/linux/linux_ima.inc
FILESEXTRAPATHS:append := "${THISDIR}/linux:"

SRC_URI += " \
     ${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'ima', 'file://ima.scc', '', d)} \
"

do_configure:append() {
     if [ "${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'ima', 'yes', '', d)}" = "yes" ]; then
         sed -i "s|^CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=.*|CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=\"${IMA_EVM_ROOT_CA}\"|" .config
     fi
}

KERNEL_FEATURES:append = " ${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'modsign', ' features/ima/modsign.scc', '', d)}"

inherit ${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'modsign', 'kernel-modsign', '', d)}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This now filters the inclusion of ima.scc and the configure only runs under that same condition.
