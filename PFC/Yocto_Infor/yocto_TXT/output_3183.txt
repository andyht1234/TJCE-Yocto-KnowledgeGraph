Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.1.9 was released.
*	The prserv rewrite is still pending on resolving the issues with
python asyncio.
*	Alexandre Belloni/Bootlin have been taking over some of the patch
testing/queuing work over the last couple of weeks, feedback to either
Richard/Alexandre or the TSC on how this is working is welcome.
*	Intermittent autobuilder issues continue to occur, about 50% of the
open issues are now ptest failures, many occurring more frequently on arm
and the rest are various other races or timeouts. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT
*	We have made progress on a couple of the race issues and on one of
the ptest issues (util-linux), some of the ptest issues and the bitbake
server timeout issue are now our most frequently encountered issues.
*	A rootfs license race issue (#
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14123> 14123) now has
reproduction steps which should allow a fix to follow.
*	The multiconfig changes in bitbake continue to cause problems, we
still need simpler test cases to reproduce issues rather than huge builds.
The existing patches seem to fix some workloads and break others and current
test cases are very slow to work with.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
