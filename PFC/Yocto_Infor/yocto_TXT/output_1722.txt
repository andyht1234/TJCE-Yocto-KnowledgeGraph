Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.1 M1 was released
*	YP 3.1.17 rc2 is due to be released (fixed for the openssl ptest
issue are queued)
*	We're taking normal development work, recipe upgrades, bug fixes and
so on, nothing too major to report.
*	Patch metrics are in a reasonable position thanks to continued and
sustained work over time to try and control the level and status of patches
in OE-Core.
*	WDD is also lower than it has been for a while, thanks to bugzilla
cleanup and issues being addressed by a number of people.
*	At the risk of sounding like a stuck record, we continue to see
intermittent autobuilder failures which result in a need to retry builds.
This is a significant concern and uses up a lot of time/resources to try and
investigate and fix.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
