There is a build error when using openscap-native sstate cache mirror.
Steps to reproduce:
Create a new build project in build-1 directory.
$ bitbake openscap-native

Then remove all directories in build-1 directory except sstate-cache.
Use the sstate-cache directory as sstate mirror.

Create another new build project in build-2 directory.
Set SSATE_MIRRORS to point to the sstate-cache in build-1 directory.
$ bitbake scap-security-guide

Error message:
OpenSCAP Error: Schema file 'sds/1.3/scap-source-data-stream_1.3.xsd' not found in path
'/build-1/tmp-glibc/work-shared/openscap/oscap-build-artifacts/usr/share/openscap/schemas' when trying to validate
'/build-2/tmp-glibc/work/corei7-64-wrs-linux/scap-security-guide/0.1.67/build/ssg-openembedded-ds.xml'
[/build-1/tmp-glibc/work/x86_64-linux/openscap-native/1.3.8/git/src/source/validate.c:103]

The oscap command from openscap-native tries to find the schema files in
build-1 directory since these paths are hardcoded when building
openscap-native.

We need to pass the correct cpe/schemas/xsl paths to oscap to make sure
it can find the files in right location.
