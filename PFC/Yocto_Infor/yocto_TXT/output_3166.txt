YP AB Intermittent failures meeting
===================================
July 1, 2021, 9 AM ET
https://windriver.zoom.us/j/3696693975

Attendees:  Tony, Richard, Trevor, Randy


Summary:

========



The autobuilder RCU hang is still fixed ;-),
    master branch builds greener.

ptest failures are the top problem now.



Add Michael Halstead, see questions below in section 4.



If anyone wants to help, we could use more eyes on the logs,

particularly the summary logs and understanding iostat #

when the dd test times out.





Plans for the week:



===================





   Richard: glibc upgrade, etc.



   Alex: ?



   Sakib: pub/non-release link upgrade, script clean-up.



   Trevor: make job server test. Try it on YP AB!!! What type of build?



   Tony: fix/work-around valgrind ptest bug:
      none/tests/amd64/fb_test_amd64
   Saul: nothing this week for YP.



   Randy: vacation, then email catch-up!




Meeting Notes:

==============


1, runqemu

Tony having trouble with runqemu on some Wind River machine.

Richard has a fix for a race in runqemu in master-next.

These might be related but if not Tony should debug the
issue/ collect logs.

2. job server

- Trevor has conclusive evidence that the 'make' job server is useful.
   email summary to come. Need to fix some assumptoins in code that
   parses PARALLEL_MAKE then send patch to yocto-autobuilder-helper.

- ninja will have to be done next.


3. AB status

  generally better but...

  ptests are having some recurring problems.
  - parted - only on arm?
  - valgrind - none/tests/amd64/fb_test_amd64
  - gdb test failing again. - Randy!

4. Richard reported
    - something really flaky going on with serial ports.
    - particularly bad on qemuppc but also x86.
    - related to Saul's QMP data dump?

5. Sakib needs to send patch to make testimage failures
    generate summary logs.

6. Richard says that we may need to redesign the data collection system
    that Sakib's AB INT tests are based on.





Still relevant parts of
Previous Meeting Notes:
=======================

1. The qemu RCU hang has been fixed to not deadlock anymore!

It still  hangs at times but this dramatically reduces the
AB failures.



4. bitbake server timeout.

    "Timeout while waiting for a reply from the bitbake server (60s)"

    Randy mentioned that the bitbake server timeouts seen in the
    Wind River build cluster have gone away after upgrading to
    a newer version of docker.

    Old: Docker Version: Docker version 18.09.4, build d14af54266
    New: Docker Version: Docker version 20.10.7, build f0df350


    Clearly the YP ABs aren't running in docker but what
    about firmware and kernel tunings.

    Michael,

    Is the BIOS/firmware kept up to date on most nodes?

    It seems that we are running stock kernels which makes sense but
    given that we don't have concerns about privacy since system access
    is controlled and the nodes are being used to test open
    source software, we might consider optimizing for performance
    rather than security.

    Alex pointed at: https://make-linux-fast-again.com/
    Which just lists a set of kernel boot options:
       noibrs noibpb nopti nospectre_v2 nospectre_v1  \
       l1tf=off nospec_store_bypass_disable no_stf_barrier \
       mds=off tsx=on tsx_async_abort=off mitigations=off

    Can we enable some or all of these on a node to see what the
    performance difference is?


5. io stalls

    Richard said that it would make sense to write an ftrace utility
    / script to monitor io latency and we could install it with sudo
    Ch^W mentioned ftrace on IRC.
    Sakib and Randy will work on that but not for a week or two.

6. Switch the pub/non-release links from full log to summary.
    The host data links on:
      https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/
    should include links to the summary data. I think we have room to
    include both links like this:
    0 1 2 3  (Full: 0 1 2 3 )

I've submitted an initial patch to yocto@lists.yoctoproject.org. My 
short notes to go along with it:

MAKE JOBSERVERS, SYSTEM LOADS, AND THE YOCTO AUTOBUILDER

INTRO

- Yocto Autobuilder has been experiencing several issues with nightly 
builds, some intermittent
- Previous discussions looking for ways to limit CPU/RAM loading (see " 
[yocto] bitbake controlling memory use" on yocto@lists.yoctoproject.org 
mailing list)
- Source packages built as part of YP builds rely on various build 
tools, including Make, Ninja. Can we use them to limit system resource 
loading, and therefore reduce build failures that occur near/beyond 
these limits?

MAKE JOBSERVER

- When the "-j" option is provided (e.g. by PARALLEL_MAKE and/or 
EXTRA_OEMAKE in local.conf), this tells Make to use that many job slots, 
e.g. PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 10" tells make to use at most 10 job slots 
during compilation
- When the "-l" or "--max-load" option is provided (also via 
PARALLEL_MAKE or EXTRA_OEMAKE in local.conf), this tells Make not to 
start *more than one job* if the system load average (as perceived by 
Make) exceeds that value. If the system load exceeds the average 
specified with the "-l" argument and there is already a Make job 
running, no new ones are started until either the existing jobs finish, 
or the system load falls below the threshold.
- No limit by default

Sources:
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Parallel
http://make.mad-scientist.net/papers/jobserver-implementation/

PROPOSED SOLUTION

- "Just do it" - put a patch in for use with the Autobuilder and see 
what shakes out
- add 'PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j N -l M"' to the yocto-autobuilder-helper 
config.json default
- Complicated slightly by Ninja not supporting the same "--debug" 
functionality as Make - this is what has been used to track the system 
load in the initial testing. To get around this, we can temporarily set 
EXTRA_OEMAKE. Without "--debug", the "-l" option still works, but there 
is no output in the do_compile logs to tell us how the actual system 
load compares to the percentage targeted by the "-l" option

I did not see any issues in my manual testing with PARALLEL_MAKE and 
EXTRA_OEMAKE set in the same manner. It appears from a recursive grep 
through the poky repository that PARALLEL_MAKE gets referenced in 
various places, but it is usually either passed directly to the build 
tool of choice, or the argument to the "-j" flag is explicitly stripped 
out for use. An example of the former is meta/classes/meson.bbclass:

...

meson_do_compile() {
     ninja -v ${PARALLEL_MAKE}
}

...

It's possible that we will run into some edge cases of course, but I 
haven't seen them in my manual testing. Builds are running now at 
https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/85/builds/1478 , 
so we should have some initial results soon.
