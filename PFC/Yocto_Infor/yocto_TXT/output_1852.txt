Hi TSC,

This build of 3.4.4 had some issues on the autobuilder:

* qemux86-64 ptest failure in lttng-tools - known issue
  https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14263
  https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/81/builds/3449
* logrotate in testimage failed on qemuarm64-armhost - known issue
  https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14686
  https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/97/builds/4490
* meta-aws shows the warnings we used to see on master about SRCREV_FORMAT:
  https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/122/builds/1129
* alma8 perf working failure - same issue as dunfell, we need the same fix
  https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/133/builds/120

I don't think any of these are blocking, just sad we have so many issues that
keep cropping up. Do we proceed to QA or retry? We have no known fix for two of
the above.

Cheers,

Richard

Hi TSC,

Intel and WR are good for QA execution.  
Shall we proceed?

Regards,
Jay

Yes please, the TSC is concerned but doesn't believe there is much we can do
about these issues and that they shouldn't affect the release quality.

Cheers,

Richard
