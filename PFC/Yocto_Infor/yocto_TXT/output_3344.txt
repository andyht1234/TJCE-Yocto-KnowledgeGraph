Hello Yocto team:

I just started with yocto and would like to know the process for switching the init manager from systemd to sysvinit.

I tried this options in config file
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "busybox"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_udev = "sysvinit"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_udev-utils = "sysvinit"
DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "sysvinit"
DEFAULT_DISTRO_FEATURES += " sysvinit"

I see a warning when building my machine:

No recipe for target:
/recipes-core/sysvinit/sysvinit_2.88dsf.bbappend

When I run this build on my target it still shows me systemd init manager...

Not sure if I am missing any options.
Could you please let me know if there are any pointers I can refer to?

Thanks,
Priya

  as i recall, all of the above can be replaced by a single assignment
to the INIT_MANAGER variable.

it will depend on release, if you are on 3.0+ then yes single setting 
will work, older releases would mean above is needed. see

Please find out which layer is adding this bbappend you could use

bitbake-layers show-appends sysvinit

It seems recipe version is newer perhaps and the bbappend is still made 
for older recipe, these things happen when you mix release branches for 
different layers.

Why do I (always) point out the obvious?

And I do need... Geniuses are not meant to fix The World to understand them!?

Geniuses should understand The World (and act properly)!

Extras to geniality, do you, YOCTO primes, think?
_______

Robert... If I am correct, i'm I?

Should you include in docs some examples??? Yes, U should!
As for an example fix:
poky/meta/conf/distro/include/init-manager-*.con, NOT
conf/distro/include/init-manager-*.conf

(full path is more explicit, isn't it?)

And some local.conf examples/snippets (since all descriptions are here
and there very dry):

## Add systemd service
INIT_MANAGER = "systemd"
## DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
## DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED += "sysvinit"
## VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
## VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_dev_manager = "systemd"
## VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""

Where INIT_MANAGER = "systemd" replaces all commented commands below....

My two cent advice,
Zee

Thanks Robert and Raj!!

I am using Yocto 3.1 Dunfell release.

You are right about the .bbappend file. Changed the name in the overlay to
new-ver.bbappend  and no longer see the warning.

Tried setting  INIT_MANAGER  = " sysvinit" in build/conf/local.conf but
looks like generated rootfs has init file pointing to init ->
../lib/systemd/systemd

Priya.

Is it INIT_MANAGER  = " sysvinit" , or INIT_MANAGER  = "sysvinit" (no
blank at the beginning)?

Thank you,

  you don't want the leading space.

I got the idea from reading
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/migration-3.0.html?highlight=init_manager#init-system-selection

But this is exactly why we need some explicit examples. :-)

Typo. No leading space  INIT_MANAGER = "sysvinit".

Thanks,
Priya.

What about the following:

To be enhanced/added with the following:
