Hello everyone, i hope you are doing well. i am using the command vcgencmd with an image yocto on a raspberry pi zero. I get it by adding the userland recipe. I can get the camera status with the command (vcgencmd get_camera) but i can't use it to get the cpu temperature with the command (vcgencmd mesure_temp). Do you have any idea how to fix that ?

Best regards,

Safouane
