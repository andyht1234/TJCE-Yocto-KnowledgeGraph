Hi,

I am trying to remove all GPLv3 packages from my image.  The clang
toolchain is used where possible and currently there are no
dependencies on libstdc++ and as far as I can see none on libgcc but
this library is installed in the rootfs.  I've created a script to
parse all elf binaries to see which one dynamically links against
libgcc but none do.  I think it's being installed due to libgcc being
in the BASEDEPENDS but I can't see what is adding libgcc to this
variable.  I'm using the dunfell version of yocto and base.bbclass has

def base_dep_prepend(d):
    if d.getVar('INHIBIT_DEFAULT_DEPS', False):
        return ""
    return "${BASE_DEFAULT_DEPS}"

BASE_DEFAULT_DEPS = "virtual/${TARGET_PREFIX}gcc
virtual/${TARGET_PREFIX}compilerlibs virtual/libc"

BASEDEPENDS = ""
BASEDEPENDS_class-target = "${@base_dep_prepend(d)}"
BASEDEPENDS_class-nativesdk = "${@base_dep_prepend(d)}"

but when I check the BASEDEPENDS for various recipes I get

BASEDEPENDS=" clang-cross-aarch64 virtual/libc  libgcc
virtual/aarch64-poky-linux-compilerlibs  gettext-native"
BASEDEPENDS_class-nativesdk=" clang-cross-aarch64 virtual/libc  libgcc
 virtual/aarch64-poky-linux-compilerlibs "
BASEDEPENDS_class-target=" clang-cross-aarch64 virtual/libc  libgcc
virtual/aarch64-poky-linux-compilerlibs "

Is it possible to remove libgcc from the BASEDEPENDS somehow?
Although we are using Dunfell I'm happy to move to another release if
it's easier to achieve this.

Best Regards,
Martin.

I’ve never encountered anyone consider the license of libgcc to be an issue here because it has the ‘GCC exception’ clauses.  I suggest you speak to your lawyers.

Things are better with master and perhaps kirkstone too ( but did not try )
in yoe we use

RUNTIME = "llvm"
TC_CXX_RUNTIME = "llvm"
TOOLCHAIN = "clang"
CLANGSDK = "1"

and libgcc is not used. e.g. see below. however it still uses crt
files which maybe from gcc/glibc you might have to check
that I am talking about crtstuff
