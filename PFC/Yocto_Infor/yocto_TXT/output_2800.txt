Hi,

I set up a service timer to run the service every minute at times
01:10:50, 01:10:50, 01:10:50, ...

[Unit]
Description=Run watchdog job at every 1 minute
[Timer]
Unit=mwatchdog.service
OnCalendar=*-*-* *:00:50
Persistent=true
[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

But the timer was actually fired about every 8 - 9 seconds:

Mon Sep 27 01:10:06 UTC 2021 start timer
Mon Sep 27 01:10:15 UTC 2021 start timer
Mon Sep 27 01:10:23 UTC 2021 start timer

Not quite sure if it is a kernel issue or Yocto oe-core build issue or
what I could be missing, appreciate your advice.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

- jupiter

I changed OnCalendar=*-*-* *:*:50, in vain

perhaps use
OnCalendar=*-*-* *:*:00

No, the same result, completely bewildered why the timer does not work
in Yocto Linux

Thanks Khem.

Is the timer unit shadowed by some other timer?

Mind that units can live in
* `/lib/systemd/system/`,
* `/etc/systemd/system/`,
* `/run/systemd/system/`
and there's a priority.

Check here: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html

Didn't check, but I guess when you `systemctl status your.timer`, it shows the unit in effect. At least with service unit it does.  `systemctl cat your.timer` should do this as well.

Regards, Manuel
