Key Status/Updates:

   -

   YP 4.1 M2 is due to build this week.
   -

   YP 4.0.2 was released.
   -

   We have fixes in place for most of the reproducible build issues so will
   enable the buildpaths QA test by default soon once the remaining tweaks
   have merged. This will allow much easier visibility into reproducibility
   issues in people’s builds
   -

   meta-gplv2 builds have been dropped from master and the layer will no
   longer be maintained.
   -

   An issue has been identified where libstdc++ is broken when built with
   the gold linker due to patch changes that changed the build process in
   kirkstone.
   -

   Systemd is going to require usrmerge in the future. The proposed patch
   to require that distro feature will break our autobuilder configuration as
   things stand so work will be needed to try and adapt to the direction from
   upstream.
   -

   Recent changes to package.bbclass for externalsrc handling have broken
   source and license handling for the kernel, highlighting the need to better
   tests there. We don’t have a fix as yet.
   -

   There have been further proposed patches around improving the eSDK
   tooling workflows and around layer setup.
   -

   Work is continuing on the /proc/pressure monitoring code.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT


Ways to contribute:

   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
