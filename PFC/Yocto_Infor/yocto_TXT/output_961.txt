Hi,

I built cfg80211 driver externally and added it as a recipe to the system:

*KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "cfg80211"*
*install -m 755 ${S}/cfg80211.ko ${D}${nonarch_base_libdir}/modules/${KERNEL_VERSION}/extra*
**
In kernel I setup to use cfg80211 as a module.

If I copy this manually it's working but if I want build this recipe I received error:

*wlan-driver-1.0-r0 do_packagedata: The recipe wlan-driver is trying to install files into a shared area when those files already exist.*

Ofcourse I have already installed cfg80211 because it selected as a module so kernel create the file:

If I disabled cfg80211 from kernel, building is working but I received error during insmod:

*cfg80211: disagrees about version of symbol wireless_send_event
cfg80211: Unknown symbol wireless_send_event (err -22)*

Thanks

Probably you have two packages that provides that Kernel module. Kernel's default one via kernel-module-split BBClass, and yours with your recipe.

Try telling Yocto you have your own runtime provider for that driver. Into the recipe add this as well:

RPROVIDES:${PN} = " kernel-module-cfg80211-${KERNEL_VERSION}"
