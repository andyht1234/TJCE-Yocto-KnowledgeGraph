Hi,


I want to upstream recipes for syzkaller to provide an easy option to fuzz
yocto-based kernel. I would like to check if meta-security could be a good
place to add this.

Let me sketch the intended change-set:

1) DISTRO_FEATURE: Add a syzkaller distribution feature. 

2) Recipes for syzkaller: Of course shared code should be in an *.inc file
- recipe for host:  This recipe builds and deploys host binaries and needed
configuration for syzkaller. In general the host that is connected to the
fuzzing target could be of any architecture. If the fuzzing hosts architecture
equals your build hosts architecture, the native variant of this recipe can be
used. If the fuzzing hosts architecture equals the fuzzing targets architecture,
but not the build machine architecture the cross-compiled variant can be used.
That should be a rare situation though...
- recipe for target: the needed target part of course.

Those recipes should be added to the security-*-image.bb recipes. 

- kernel configuration
Syzkaller needs certain kernel configuration like CONFIG_KCOV,
CONFIG_DEBUGS_FS,... enabled. Add those in a fragment and provide a scc.


Would you be fine with adding sth like this to meta-security? Do you
have any additional/other suggestions?

Of course I would also be willing to maintain this recipe then

Thanks,
Simone

The syzkaller recipe itself is in meta-oe. Are talking about adding additional recipes to enhance syzkaller?

I see, my bad. When we originally worked on it, it was not available yet in
meta-oe. I should have rechecked... I'll take a look at the recipes there.

Sorry for the confusion.

Kind Regards,
Simone
