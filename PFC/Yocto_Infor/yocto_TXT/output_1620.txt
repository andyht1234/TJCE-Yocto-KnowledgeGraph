We are moving the hash equivalence server to dedicated servers. As part of
the change we need to change the domain.

Please update any BB_HASHSERVE_UPSTREAM
<https://docs.yoctoproject.org/bitbake/dev/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual-ref-variables.html#term-BB_HASHSERVE_UPSTREAM>
variables
from "typhoon.yocto.io:8687" to "hashserv.yocto.io:8687" at your
earliest convenience.

We plan to make the switch during the next maintenance window on Friday
July 22nd. The previous server will quickly fall out of date and be taken
offline next week.
