Current Dev Position: YP 3.5 M3

Next Deadline: 21th Feb. 2022 YP 3.5 M3 build

 

Next Team Meetings:

*	Bug Triage meeting Thursday Feb. 3rd 7:30 am PDT (

*	Twitch -  See https://www.twitch.tv/theyoctojester

 

Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.5 M2 has passed QA with one bug highlighted (14708). Due to
vacations in Asia the release, if approved, will be made next week.
*	YP 3.1.14 is ready for QA but the release will also be delayed until
next week.
*	A new Patchwork is available at
<https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/> https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/.
This new system is running the up to date mainline code and will receive
regular updates. The previous unmaintained fork remains up at
<https://patchwork.openembedded.org/> https://patchwork.openembedded.org/ to
preserve history. We are seeking help updating PatchTest to run with the new
version.

Everyone can now sign up for an account on the new system. Patchwork project
maintainers please email  <mailto:mhalstead@linuxfoundation.org>
mhalstead@linuxfoundation.org to have your access restored.

*	Upstream glibc are now planning to remove prelink support in 2.36. I
think we will still want to remove prelink from OE-Core before our next
release though, particularly as it is an LTS.
*	An
<https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/message/160881> email
proposing inclusive language changes for bitbake and OE-Core has been sent
to the community for review. The aim is to implement this before M3.
*	We are seeing networking issues during image testing on the
centos8/stream8 workers, possibly due to recent changes in the distro. Help
with debugging this welcome.
*	We have also realized there is an issue with hash equivalence where
the current mechanism will not account for different headers inside the
sysroot added through indirect dependencies (e.g. linux-libc-headers via
glibc). This means something like rtcwake in util-linux which uses rtc.h can
have differing debug symbols due to differing line numbers yet otherwise be
identical. There is a potential fix with downsides in master-next.

&format=interactive> CVE metrics are still under control for master with
pending patches accounted for (thanks Ross!) but work still remains on the
various stable branches which have high counts.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at record high levels and help is
very much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

In particular, we're struggling to understand the intermittent network issue
with external hosts we're seeing very occasionally.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
