I've a requirement in which I want to package veritysetup binary in a minimal filesystem (which is size constraint)
Including "cryptsetup" package in IMAGE_INSTALL is adding the binary but also a lot of shared libraries which are its dependencies. The shared libraries are increasing the size of the filesystem, which should not be done. I do not need functionalities like ssl for veritysetup, so how can I remove the dependencies on these shared libraries?

I've tried removing eg ssl from https://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/tree/meta-oe/recipes-crypto/cryptsetup/cryptsetup_2.4.3.bb#n29 but the shared libs are still the dependency.

You need to be more specific, otherwise it is not clear how can we
help. Show exactly what you did, and what happened (or didn't happen
even though you expected that).

The basic way to trim dependencies is to set PACKAGECONFIG to a minimal set.

It sounds like you are trying to build a runtime overlay package that omits
all dependencies. If so, this might help.
