Hi,

I'm working with dunfell and want to compile and install the drivers for 
the Laird LWB5+ module (available from 
https://github.com/LairdCP/meta-laird-cp).
I have included the path to the layer in meta-laird-cp-pre-3.4 in my 
`bblayers.conf` and since I need the networkmanager and with information 
from their support team (don't trust the README apparently), I've added 
`lrd-networkmanager-sterling` to the `IMAGE_INSTALL` list in 
`sample-image-cp-lwb5plus.bb`. When I invoke `$ bitbake 
sample-image-cp-lwb5plus`, I keep getting:

     | 
/usr/src/debug/lrd-networkmanager-sterling/10.4.0.10-r0/build/../lrd-network-manager-10.4.0.10/src/nmcli/common.c:904: 
undefined reference to `rl_echo_signal_char'

even though I've added `readline` to the `DEPENDS` list. Why is this? I 
expected the `rl_echo_signal_char` dependency to be resolved, any hints?

It may help if you show the complete logs for configure and compile ,
otherwise there is not enough information in your message to diagnose the
issue.

missing readline dependency ?

Are you using meta-gplv2? That function doesn’t exist yet in the version of readline provided by that layer.

Okay, yes, sorry about that, the compile output for bitbake 
sample-image-cp-lwb5plus looks like:

rl_echo_signal_char is a symbol from readline per 
https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html

I see, yes my project is using "meta-gplv2".

Should removal of that layer help, or would you recommend that I update 
the readline version within it to the latest? (and provide an upstream 
patch to: https://github.com/lgirdk/meta-gplv2 ?

Thanks!
Ron

If your project doesn’t have any special requirements about not using (L)GPLv3-licensed packages, then dropping meta-gplv2 is by far the best option.
The dependency on readline comes from Networkmanager’s user interfaces (nmcli, nmtui). If you can live without them, disabling them is also an alternative.

Regards,
Anders

I can imagine that meta-gpl2 was in fact added in the first place for
exactly that reason. NM is a red hat project, and red hat has no
concerns for those pesky embedded linux needs. There's no
configuration switch to disable readline specifically. I vaguely
remember that in a similar situation I disabled nmcli/tui for the
product images but kept them in developer images.

Updating readline to a gpl3 licensed version is not an option at all,
as it would result in a product that you cannot ship.

Alex

I'll attempt to "just drop" meta-gplv2, then. However I see that there 
are other dependencies on readline too, i.e. it might be easier to just 
replace the existing 5.2 version in meta-gplv2 with 8.2 from here:

I need nmcli for configuration purposes, disabling it won't work for me.

No. You cannot 'just replace' it, as they are under different
licenses, and meta-gplv2 specifically collects versions under gpl
version 2 only.

Are you going to ship what you're working on to other users, or is it
just experimentation?

you can also look into replacing readline with editline and see if
this would work for your package needs. That will be one less package
needed from meta-gpl2

The intent is, that's it's going to be shipped (but with full access to

https://www.gnu.org/licenses/rms-why-gplv3.en.html specifies:

"When we say that GPLv2 and GPLv3 are incompatible, it means there is no 
legal way to combine code under GPLv2 with code under GPLv3 in a single 
program." - What is a single program though? Readline would still be a 
single program within the bitbake build, would it not? I'm not 
"stealing" nor editing its code but compile it as is.

libedit is the editline library under meta-devtools:

I replaced replaced readline with libedit in

If you're shipping anything that is under gplv3 you also need to give
the recipient users a possibility to change the item under gplv3 from
the source code you have used to build it and install their modified
version to replace yours.

Are you able to fulfil that obligation you have under the license?

Combining gpl2 and gpl3 is not an issue here. The issue is that if you
ship gpl3 items to users as a part of some product, you have an
obligation to allow them to change those items and install the changes
on the product. This is why meta-gplv2 was created: it effectively
reverts everything that is nowadays gpl3 licensed to older versions
which are still under gpl2.

Single program is commonly interpreted as a runtime process with its
own virtual address space. E.g. all linked libraries, even 3rd party
ones, are a part of the single program.

Yes, that will definitely be doable for the recepient if they chose to 
do so.

I'm curious as to how though. Are you going to give them a complete
set of yocto layers and source code for everything that goes into the
image, so that they can replicate the yocto build? If they choose to
replace readline with their own version, I don't see any other way.

Note that we are not talking about the manufacturer of the device, we
are talking about the actual end users who will buy and use the device
for its intended purpose.

Exactly, the customer will have full access to the source code incl. the 
complete set of Yocto layers and all.

Then your best option is to drop meta-gplv2 layer from builds altogether.
This will update everything to current, compatible versions that are easier
to fix if needed.

Just to be on the safe side, you do need to find out why it was added
though. The reason may still hold.
