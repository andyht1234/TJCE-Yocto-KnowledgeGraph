I need to resurrect a Yocto Project build environment based on honister. 
My dev system has since moved on to a newer glibc etc. As expected, I am 
getting this warning

WARNING: Your host glibc version (2.37) is newer than that in uninative 
(2.34). Disabling uninative so that sstate is not corrupted.

The distro's gcc now is 13.2.1.

Now the following packages do not compile anymore:

  * rust-llvm-native : which there is a patch (applied to kirkstone):
    https://lore.kernel.org/openembedded-core/CANPvuR=G1NxfJb67xD19FoNh4eTDsTM4TDyF+vDbh6crNH=dgw@mail.gmail.com/T/
  * libdnf-native : because std::uint32_t does not exist anymore

I don't care about the sstate as I am creating a new one. However, how 
can I force uninative to be used and would it even solve the problem (I 
would think so as the idea of uninative is to isolate the build from the 
host libraries)?

Thanks,
Rudi

You should rather use buildtools. You can install those with
scripts/install-buildtools. The -r option is there to allow you to
select a target release. You can try something like:

poky/scripts/install-buildtools -d ~/YP/buildtools -r yocto-3.4.4 --installer-version 3.4.4

This will then tell you to source buildtools/environment-setup-x86_64-pokysdk-linux

This should be enough to be able to build old releases.

Thank you, Alexandre.

OK, I did that. The environment only adds the paths. Then I sourced the 
build environment as usual. Unfortunately, it still fails with the same 
error messages.

By using an older buildtools-extended tarball you should be able to
gain an older host compiler version which will avoid the compile
failures you mention. I suspect uninative will need to be disabled but
that shouldn't matter for your use case as you're not sharing the
sstate.

Cheers,

Richard

real issue would be getting native packages compiling with newer
compilers, unless you are ready to do such backports this
is going to be a problem. I would suggest using a supported/tested
distro for honister release inside a VM or container to build it.

Thanks, Khem. Yes, that is what I eventually resorted doing. It's much 
quicker to fire up a VM than trying to do the backports. :)
