I'm attempting to create a USB first boot tarball for our custom iMX6 board that would contain the imx-usb-loader executable, config files and u-boot/SPL files. The goal being to deploy that to the production machine to program the empty boards right after being assembled.

While I had plenty of hurdles figuring out how to do this (I'm still pretty newbie with Yocyo), I managed to get everything just the way I wanted it. But when I get the tarball to the production machine, which runs the exact same Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Linux as the build machine, the imx_usb tool won't run. The reason being that it's missing some library. Running LDD on the executable turns up this:

└─$> ldd usr/bin/imx_usb
   linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffd7031d000)
   libusb-1.0.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libusb-1.0.so.0 (0x00007f986a47e000)
   libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f986a0b4000)
   libudev.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 (0x00007f986a86c000)
   libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f9869e97000)
   /home/jpdoyon/newtrax-layersetup-dunfell/build/tmp/sysroots-uninative/x86_64-linux/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f986a696000)
   librt.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 (0x00007f9869c8f000)

Why is the ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 using an absolute path while all the other libraries aren't?

If I install the library in the location above, then the executable starts working... So how do I make sure Yocto doesn't do this?

yocto provides a layer to abstract native binaries on top of build
host and thats what you are seeing. Its as designed.

Native recipes are meant for the build machine itself to aid your build. If
you are packaging something to run on a destination machine, you should be
producing non-native recipe images.
