Hello,

the following commit needs the variable SDK_BUILD_PATH which doesn't seem to exist in the dunfell branch: https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/meta/files/toolchain-shar-relocate.sh?h=dunfell&id=d6f40be29bf56a835f5825692a22365f04aeb6c3
This leads to countless messages being displayed during the installation:

sed: -e expression #1, char 0: no previous regular expression

Shouldn't the process be aborted with an error message at the first problem?

Many greetings,
Matthias

It appears that dunfell also should have:
https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/commit/?id=bc4ee5453560dcefc4a4ecc5657df5cc1666e153

Could you see if this resolves the issue?

Hello Steve,

Can you push the commit to the dunfell branch, or do I need to open an official bug somewhere, or what is the correct procedure?

Best regards,
Matthias

I completed testing and the commit is in the group I sent to the list
for review earlier today.  If there are no objections I'll send a pull
request early next week.
