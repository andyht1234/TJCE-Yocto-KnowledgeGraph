Hello,

Can anyone suggest how to make a python script executable on the yocto image? I 've been trying with the pyinstaller but didn't work, I made it executable on my laptop and transfer it to yocto image but didn't work also,
Has any one tried it before? are there other alternatives?

If you're sure you only use standard python libs it's fairly easy.

make a recipe (name it how ever you like)

SCR_URI = "file://<your script>.py"

do_install() {
     install -m 0755 <your script>.py ${bindir}/<your script>.py
}

RDEPENDS:${PN} += "python3-core"

in the image

IMAGE_INSTALL += "<your recipe name>"

---

if your script needs further libraries, reference them in the recipe with

RDEPENDS:${PN} += "python3-core dependency1 dependency2 dependency3..."

Then you call the result on your device with <your script>.py from any 
console

Maybe add a "#!/usr/bin/env python3" shebang as a first line to your script
