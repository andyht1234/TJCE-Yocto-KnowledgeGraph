Hello,

I am trying to upgrade my distro from rocko to zeus.
After I fixed all the initial parsing and build problems I have
reached a point where the linux-imx doesn't build. Maybe I am
underestimating the task in front of me, but I have already seen it
done.

The error looks like this:

| .../kernel-source/Makefile:947: recipe for target 'fs' failed
| make[2]: *** [fs] Error 2
| Makefile:146: recipe for target 'sub-make' failed
| make[1]: *** [sub-make] Error 2
| Makefile:24: recipe for target '__sub-make' failed
| make: *** [__sub-make] Error 2
| WARNING: exit code 1 from a shell command.
|
ERROR: Task (.../meta-mylayer/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-imx_4.1.15.bb:do_compile)
failed with exit code '1'

Is it possible that I am using the wrong linux-imx version? I have
tried a few but to no avail.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Dule

perhaps there is more specific compiler error in logs above that ?

AFAICS 4.1.15 doesn't match any kernel recipes in the zeus branches of
either meta-freescale or meta-imx, it might go easier if you based off of
the 5.4.x kernel recipes one of those use...

Here is the error:

| .../kernel-source/include/linux/log2.h:22:1: warning: ignoring
attribute 'noreturn' because it conflicts with attribute 'const'
[-Wattributes]
|    22 | int ____ilog2_NaN(void);

| make[4]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
|   CC      fs/cifs/smb2maperror.o
| In file included from .../kernel-source/include/linux/kernel.h:11,

However, now that I have switched to linux-imx-4.14.98 I made
significant progress.
It looks like it's going to work, I'll keep you posted.

Best regards,
Dule
