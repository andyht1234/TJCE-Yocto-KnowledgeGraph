Using poky/kirkstone as a base, I am sideloading an app that requires libcrypto.so.1.0.0 and libssl.so.1.0.0 which are not present by default. I have seen suggestions to include various "10" packages such as libcrypto10 etc but they don't seem to be present or at least not in poky /meta-openembedded. Is there a (straightforward) way to get yocto to include multiple versions of libssl.so /libcrypto.so (  (via IMAGE_INSTALL:append etc..).short of manually copying them in?

Thanks,
Bruce
