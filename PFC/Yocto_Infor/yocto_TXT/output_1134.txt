I have a recipe for an application. I want it to download its code from the Git repo only if it does not already exist at a specific location on the file system.
How can I go about achieving this?

Thanks

Can you explain the context and use case please?

Thank you for getting back.

Context/Use case:
My current recipe always checks out code from the git repo before building it.
During development, I want to first build my code successfully before pushing it to the repo. Hence I want the recipe to check if the code exists at a certain location on the file system. If it does, it should build that. If it doesn't it should checkout the code from the repo before building it.

Thanks

'devtool modify' should help with that. It will clone the source code
into a 'workspace' folder, and set up a .bbappend in the same
workspace that would instruct bitbake to build from that location
instead of fetching from git. When you're done, there are several
other 'devtool' subcommands to finish up, and revert to building from
git.

Let me look into devtool. Thanks!
