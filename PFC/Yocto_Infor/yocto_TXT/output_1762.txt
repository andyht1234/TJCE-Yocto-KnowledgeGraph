Hello,

we are experiencing build failures of the meta-agl build on the Yocto
autobuilders with this error message:

ERROR: Nothing RPROVIDES 'polkit' (but /home/pokybuild/yocto-worker/meta-agl-core/build/meta-agl/meta-agl-core/recipes-platform/packagegroups/packagegroup-agl-graphical-weston.bb RDEPENDS on or otherwise requires it)

Here are a few logs:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/120/builds/1239/steps/12/logs/stdio
https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/120/builds/1240/steps/13/logs/stdio
https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/120/builds/1241/steps/12/logs/stdio

The error started showing up today, and given the error message it is
possibly related with this commit on meta-agl master:

  packagegroup-agl-graphical-weston: Add polkit to RDEPENDS

https://git.automotivelinux.org/AGL/meta-agl/commit/?id=a8c060f736a66dde56cc2ba1803d35531c62d610

Do you think the above error can be caused by this commit?

Best regards.

[snip]

For an immediate fix I've moved the polkit addition to a bbappend added
via BBFILES_DYNAMIC, gated on meta-oe presence.  The current intent is
that the meta-agl-core test on the autobuilder only need poky, so letting
this slip in was a thinko on our part.  We may revisit making meta-oe a
required dependency when binary packagefeed prototyping starts in AGL.
Your comment re features_check is right on, I'll add that when I get a
chance over the weekend.  One thing I may bring up on the next dev call
is Weston does need polkit in some situations (hence the addition in
AGL), so maybe shifting it to oe-core starts to make more sense now...

Cheers,

Scott

Thanks for taking care. I confirm my testing build today didn't show up
this failure anymore.

Adding Joshua, I'm hoping he might have some ideas here?

That patch in question fixed a regression in systemd behavior that was
introduced at some point that broke the non-polkit behavior. I was
able to get it fixed, but I also suspect that fighting against using
polkit isn't going to be productive in the long run and we should look
at a way to pull it in..... preferably without needing mozjs (why a
policy system decided to rely on javascript is beyond me). Eventually,
we are going to want polkit-only features from systemd and there won't
be grounds (like "This worked before polkit") to get upstream systemd
to change to support it.

oe-core and poky master already switched from mozjs to duktape with polkit.
I've cherry-picked these changes for my own branches of older yocto releases.
