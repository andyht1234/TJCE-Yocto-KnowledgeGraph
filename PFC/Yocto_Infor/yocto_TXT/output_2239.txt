Currently DKMS is not supported in Yocto/OE and there are no imminent plans to change that. See the discussion on the topic at https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/message/159558

Maybe you can work out something for yourself using NIâ€™s layer as mentioned in https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/message/159694

Greetz,
Josef
