Add "-l 52" to PARALLEL_MAKE in config.json to limit Make and Ninja
builds based on the detected system load. With this option added, if
either tool has at least one job running and detects that the system
load exceeds the given value, it will wait until either the system load
average drops below that limit, or until all other jobs are finished
before starting additional jobs.

Since most autobuilder machines have 56 cores, this should help keep the
system from being overloaded during builds.
