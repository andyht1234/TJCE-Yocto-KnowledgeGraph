Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.1.9 has been through QA and is awaiting release approval, no
blocking issues were identified.
*	YP 3.4 M1 was released.
*	Significantly for the project, we have now identified a kernel hang
caused from RCU stalls which has been plaguing our autobuilder testing for
months. The issue is still open in upstream mainline kernels but there is a
patch queued in the rcu tree for it. Since applying this patch to
linux-yocto, our builds have been noticeably greener and more stable. We
have closed out many of the related AB-INT bugs and will be creating new
ones for any remaining issues as they occur since it is hard to tell some
other bugs apart from the RCU issue.
*	The prserv rewrite to use asyncio is stuck on autobuilder hangs when
testing at larger scale. We'd welcome help from anyone with more details
asyncio knowledge/experience as it is looking like the new code isn't
entirely stable in python 3.5/3.6 and may have "at exit" issues, as well as
perhaps issues mixing async io code on the client side with multiprocessing
during parsing.
*	There does still seem to be an arm specific LTP hang reading
/proc/kmsg now tracked by bug
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14460> 14460.
*	The multiconfig changes in bitbake continue to cause problems, we
still need simpler test cases to reproduce issues rather than huge builds.
The existing patches seem to fix some workloads and break others. Richard is
trying to fix but trying to fix autobuilder issues and other problems and
these are slow builds to debug.
*	Intermittent autobuilder issues continue to occur, about 50% of the
open issues are now ptest failures and the rest are various other races or
timeouts. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to see by
searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
