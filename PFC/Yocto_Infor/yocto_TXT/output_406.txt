Dear Maintainers,

I'm using the meta-security with Kirkstone version to use discrete TPM with STM32MP1.

I'm facing 3 issues :

  *   The packagegroup does not include libtss2-tcti-device library ==> mandatory to use discrete TPM.
  *   The packagegroup does not include tpm2-openssl ==> support of TPM provides for openssl v3.x
  *   Tpm2-tools is on release 5.2 which has an issue with tpm2_nvread (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2158598) ==> could it be possible to update it at least to release 5.4
Thanks,

Best Regards,

Benjamin

Does this Mickledore commit address the issue?
https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-security/commit/meta-tpm/recipes-core/packagegroup?id=8a7112d37bfe0157289ed7e6baeb1d7e37707b29

Mind sending a patch to add this to master and I will backport to kirkstone.

The changes between 5.2 and 5.4 include many new functions/features.  
You can either carry that recipe local or give Mickledore a try.

yes, this one is working on Kirkstone

Based on Mickledore commit, you can add tpm2-openssl in the list of dependencies for the packagegroup-security-tpm2

I have seen that Mickledore use the version 5.4 already. 
The other dependencies seem OK. 
As this is only the tpm2-tools package and I don't have the choice of the Yocto release, I have made a local modification to use 5.4

Best Regards,

Benjamin
