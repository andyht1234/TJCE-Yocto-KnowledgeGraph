i cleaned out -Werror wherever possible with command:

sed -i 's/-Werror//g' $(find . -type f -exec egrep -l _no_Werror {} \;)

and elfutils is builded

Please try backporting this fix

https://sourceware.org/git/?p=elfutils.git;a=commit;h=a01938d584b91e747167bb4b3f30ec300c4d6e43

if this is not enough then I think you just need to edit config/eu.am to 
remove -Werror and perhaps thats enough, but upstream elfutils is 
generally receptive to
Werror issues, so I would also suggest that in parallel you report it
upstream as well.

you could try to add a line like this to your recipe:

CFLAGS:append = " -Wno-error=missing-attributes"
