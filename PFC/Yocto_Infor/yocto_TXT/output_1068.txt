Hi,

I am trying to configure an image to conform to the VHD size alignment
requirements of Azure. Azure requires that the filesize of a VHD be a
multiple of 1 MiB. The '--align' option works to align the _start_ of a
partition to a particular multiple, but I need the _end_ to be aligned.
As a workaround, I tried:

part /fake --fixed-size=0 --no-table --align=1024

I figured this would create a zero-sized partition which would be
appropriately aligned at the end of the image, but wic complains that
zero-sized partitions are not allowed.

Is there a way to achieve this, or extend the capabilities of wic to
handle this use case?

Best,
Ben

There is; the source code for wic and its tests are fully available to
you, so you are welcome to implement the missing bits and submit them
for review and inclusion.

Also, we do not have a wic maintainer.
