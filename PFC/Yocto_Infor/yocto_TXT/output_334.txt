Good idea, as this version has been unsupported for a pretty long time now.
A good idea could be to switch to our Kirkstone Long Term Support 
release, which will be supported until 2026.

According to the documentation, however, RHEL is not supported. However, 
we support Fedora and AlmaLinux. See 
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.11/ref-manual/system-requirements.html

I hope this helps
Michael.

RHEL was actually never supported directly; the testing was done on
CentOS. With recent fallout from Red Hat's decision to no longer
publish the source code for RHEL, I'm not sure it's going to be
possible to gurantee RHEL compatibility; depends on what RHEL clones
decide to do and how much they're going to diverge.

I'd rather build on a non-enterprise distro; in a container if you must.
