Hi all,

We have a customer using hardknott & kirkstone who needs a newer cmake
version. Looking at mickledore, it has a version of cmake that has the
features they require.

Would it be acceptable to submit a patch to backport this version of
cmake to these older YP releases? I'm not sure on the policy so I just
want to check before proceeding.

Thanks
Rich

CMake version update would be against stable and LTS rules:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Stable_Release_and_LTS#Stable.2FLTS_Patch_Acceptance_Policies

I have done similar updates on a private poky fork though. Cherry-picking the needed
patches can be doable, but all this depends on the details...

Cheers,

Thank you, that is just what I was looking for ðŸ™‚

I have a private layer with this version of cmake and it seems to be
working fine. Was just wondering if it could be more official.

Many thanks!
