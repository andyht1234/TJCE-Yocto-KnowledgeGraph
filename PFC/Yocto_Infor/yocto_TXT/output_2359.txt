Hi,

I assume it shouldn't be empty resov. conf. Manually I am updating nameserver always. but when I reboot my machine it's empty. So for this, I want to make permanent my nameserver always. I have added packages support IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " resolvconf" but I am not able to fix this solution. Can anybody know this issue please guide me. How always will be automatically set without manual effort?

Hello,
Some more details would be needed (ie. you have systemd?), but this could
be a good point to start: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-resolved

(ie. see a bit down, like:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-resolved#Manually )

Cheers,
Federico
