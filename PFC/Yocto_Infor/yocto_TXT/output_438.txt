Hi,

I am using the poky connman_1.37 recipe and the wpa-supplicant_2.9 recipe. When I get the services from Connman I get duplicates access points:

```
connmanctl> services
my-access-point wifi_02...
my-access-point wifi_00...
```

I am able to connect to the ones with wifi_00*, but not the ones like wifi_02*. Why are there two access points and why does only one of them "work?" I have removed systemd-networkd from my image.

I have attempted to downgrade to connman_1.35 (from an older version of Yocto which does not have this problem) but to no avail.

Thank you,
Logan

To whom it may concern,

It appears some services are from the `wlan` interface while other are from the `p2p` interface of the same physical Wi-Fi module. The addresses of the devices are, `00:1f:7b:31:8f:32` and `02:1f:7b:b5:8f:32`, which result in the 00 vs 02 phenomenon I noticed.

Thank you,
Logan

Hi

You can blacklist the other interface
