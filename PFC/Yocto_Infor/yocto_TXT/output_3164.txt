This adds the "-l" option to PARALLEL_MAKE in config.json with an
initial testing value of 100 (100% system load). This option is supported
by both Make and Ninja. However, we also require the "--debug=j" option
to be passed to Make in order for the latter to report perceived system
load in the do_compile logs, and since this option is not supported by
Ninja, also add EXTRA_OEMAKE to the EXTRAVARS so that we can determine if
the target load percentage needs to be adjusted.

I seem to vaguely remember that -l is not actually taking a percentage, but
an absolute value that is specific to the amount of CPU cores a system has.
Have you verified your assumption?

You are right that it's not actually a percentage and is instead tied to 
the number of cores. I'll correct the patch body to reflect this when I 
inevitably send a v2. With the latest testing on the AB, my suspicion 
that "-l 100" is too generous for most machines is being confirmed...
