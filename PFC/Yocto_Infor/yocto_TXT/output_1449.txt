Hi Jerome,

Parsec doesn't depend on optee-client and doesn't require it at all. If Parsec is built with the Trusted Services provider includedÂ  then `libts` is added into DEPENDS and RDEPENDS:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-security/tree/meta-parsec/recipes-parsec/parsec-service/parsec-service_1.0.0.bb#n23

The libts recipe (it will be merged into meta-arm later today or tomorrow together with other generic recipes for Trusted Services Secure Partitions (SWd side) and test/demo tools (NWd side)) creates `teeclnt` group.

Cheers,
Anton

The latest version of parsec-service recipe adds parsec into teeclnt group if Parsec is built with TS provider:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-security/tree/meta-parsec/recipes-parsec/parsec-service/parsec-service_1.0.0.bb#n75

In this case teeclnt group is created by libts recipe (it will be merged into meat-arm later this week).

With your change it's not clear what recipe will create the group. Could you point me to this recipe.

Anton

* [meta-security][PATCH resend] Parsec-service: add parsec user to teeclnt group when optee is present

The optee-client package provides a PKCS#11 interface that may be used by
Parsec with the below configuration. For this to work, the parsec user
needs to be a member of the teeclnt group. Therefore, add it when 'optee'
is present in MACHINE_FEATURES.

 # Provider configuration in /etc/parsec/config.toml
 [[provider]]
 name = "pkcs11-optee"
 provider_type = "Pkcs11"
 key_info_manager = "sqlite-manager"
 library_path = "/usr/lib/libckteec.so.0"

This is a resend because a few hours after my initial post I still can't
find it at https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/messages. I am now
subscribed to the list so hopefully it will help (although
https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-security/tree/README doesn't mention
subscription).
