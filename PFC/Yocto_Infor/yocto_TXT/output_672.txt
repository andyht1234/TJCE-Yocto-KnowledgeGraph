Hi Yocto Community,

First time Yocto builder here..

I am currently working with Yocto v3.1 and creating a custom image for
an iMX6 processor from Toradex, and the single objective is to display a
Qt5 application. It works great, and I managed to make the GUI autostart on
boot.

Now my only issue is that upon bootup, I will see the command line output
also be redirected to the HDMI screen. Once the GUI displays, the CLI
output, if any, will continue on top of the GUI.
I'd like to only resort to the serial port to read the command line output
(e.g. puTTY), and want to prevent it from displaying on the HDMI monitor.

In U-Boot, I was able to manually remove it post-installation by modifying
the following arguments from the "setup" env variable:
- Remove console=tty1
- Added vt.global_cursor_default=0

But this way of editing the variable is only persistent on a single board
and I want this to be pre-set on my Yocto image for production purposes.

Since I'm new to this, I absolutely have no idea what to do or where to
look. Any recommendations on how to disable CLI to display screen?

Thanks in advance,
Anthony
