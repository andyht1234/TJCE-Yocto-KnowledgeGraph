Hi Yocto experts,

I'm a Yocto newbiee and I have a concern regarding the slowness of Yocto for our team(around 100 people). There are two main reasons for this:

1. Yocto itself is slower compared to other build systems.
2. Each user in our team has their own private SSTATE_DIR and DL_DIR, which means the artifacts cannot be shared. This leads to unnecessary disk and CPU usage.
3. Every user works on SATA devices, so the IOPS and throughput are both low.

Since it's hard for us to invest in expensive enterprise NVMe for all build servers, I have an idea to address this issue. My suggestion is to use Lustre/NFS/Glustrefs along with small NVMe to share everyone's SSTATE/DL_DIR.

I prefer Lustre over NFS because Lustre offers superior IO performance scalability, making it suitable for data-intensive tasks. It splits the data, allowing it to be requested from one server but sent from one or more other servers.

For the storage of SSTATE/DL_DIR only, the size requirement would not be high, so a small NVMe should be sufficient. NVMe can provide much higher throughput and IOPS compared to our current slow SATA, so I guess it can meet our needs. If necessary, we can easily add another NVMe to another server since Lustre is a distributed file system. The overall cost would not be significant.

My questions are:
1. Are there any errors in my understanding?
2. Is this solution feasible? If not, why? If yes, can it be further improved?

I look forward to hearing from you!

Regards,
Li

SSTATE_DIR and DL_DIR are writable. Sharing them among different builds 
owned/controlled by the same user is OK, but sharing these writable 
directories among different users does not seem to be a good idea.
You could consider using the PREMIRRORS and SSTATE_MIRRORS.

Qi

This is not accurate. SSTATE_DIR is designed to be shared in a
read-write fashion via NFS or other over the network filesystem
(between users on the same machine is also ok), and is heavily used
that way in Yocto CI.

Sharing DL_DIR is less important as it is not that large, and
downloading does not slow down the builds that much compared to the
the actual build (and only needs to happen once).

Li, your understanding is more or less completely correct. The
difficulties are mostly in scaling up, where you might hit the limits
of how many users can be served at the same time.

If you have group-sticky bits on the parent directories and a shared group that all the users are members of then you can share sstate and dldir between different users.

That’s the theory, at least.  The last time I tried this in production there was a bug in sstate writing where the permissions would be incorrectly changed, but I couldn’t replicate with master so possibly this has been fixed.

NFS is known to work fine (the autobuilder uses a NFS mount for sstate/dldir across tens of builders), and people have reported that Cephfs works well too.  I’m not aware of anyone using Lustre.

But sharing the same SSTATE_DIR with people running cleansstate or 
manually removing entries is an issue as far as I remember. I don't know 
if mount allows to mount file systems with read and write but not erase 
permissions?

On a separate note, we've setup NFS donwload cache for Buildroot and 
Yocto and for one (maybe both?) we had an issue with filelocks. 
Basically we had one disk on one of the build servers which we exposed 
through NFS share to other build servers and users. However, the 
filelocks weren't respected when one was set in NFS (or ext4) and 
checked against in ext4 (or NFS respectively). So I suggest to be 
mindful about this when setting up your infrastructure and use the same 
FS across all users (you can mount a local FS with NFS as far as I 
remember).

I haven't done that yet but I believe one is supposed to share the 
hashequiv server too for max reusability? I am unfortunately not 
familiar with it but just wanted to raise this.

Cheers,
Quentin

This is the case I referred to as 'different builds owned/controlled by 
the same user'.

Say, you share the SSTATE_DIR used by Yocto CI to many people via NFS. 
Then, a 'rm -rf' might be typed by someone by accident, maybe just 
because of lack of coffee.

'User' is ambiguous here - user as a person, or user as a local unix
user account?
In the latter case this is likely to be misunderstood as 'sstate cache
must be private to a user account because it cannot handle multiple
readers and writers eithe locally or over the network', which it can.

This is correct. Deletion needs to happen via central procedure, and
those who cannot be trusted with that should get only r/o access.
