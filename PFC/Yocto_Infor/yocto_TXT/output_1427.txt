Greetings

If you are using the Yocto Project to build your products, and are 
allowed to mention it, one way to contribute to the project is to add 
such products to the list that we keep on our Wiki: 
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Project_Users#Products_that_use_the_Yocto_Project

Thanks in advance
Cheers
Michael.

Just to add that we also list projects and companies using the project
as well as products.

Being able to show where the project is being used and who by does help
the project "prove" it is used, the scale of the usage and why it
should be maintained and developed.

Cheers,

Richard

All,

I've updated the list a bit. I've added AsteroidOS, LuneOS and webOS OSE 
and their respective sites.

Best regards,
Herman
