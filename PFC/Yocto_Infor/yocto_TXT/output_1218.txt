When I try to: /poky/build$ bitbake core-image-minimal,
bitbake fails with the following error:

Fatal Python error: init_fs_encoding: failed to get the Python codec of the
filesystem encoding
Python runtime state: core initialized
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'

On StackOverflow, I found suggestion to set PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME
environment variables but that caused other errors.

I'm attaching the bitbake log. Please suggest what I'm missing and need to
change.

Thank you!

Hi,

please provide more details like the messages printed by bitbake at the top of the log showing your Host distro.

Whis Yocto version are you using?

Did you properly install the required packages?

Are you using a Yocto compatible distro ?

Yocto version: /poky$ git status
On branch kirkstone
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/kirkstone'.

I just followed steps from the Yocto Quick build (
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/brief-yoctoprojectqs/index.html)


About using a Yocto compatible distro, here are the details:
Operating System: Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS               ( derived from Ubuntu
22.04 LTS, so I assumed would be compatible with Yocto, but is it possible
I'm wrong?)
Kernel: Linux 5.18.10-76051810-generic

I'll repeat this in Ubuntu 22.04 docker container and let you know how it
goes.

So, I was able to build successfully using Ubuntu 22.04 docker container.
It looks something in my host OS environment didn't quite agree with Yocto.
