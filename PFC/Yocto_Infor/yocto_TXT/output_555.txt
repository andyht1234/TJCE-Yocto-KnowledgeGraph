This version supports openssl 3.1

The maintainer changed his tag versions hence the different looking
version.

The maintainer also has stopped releasing tar files and asked we
directly grab from git.

Good question. I think I got a bit turned around when I moved over to git. 

This repo has 2 LICENSE files:
  https://sourceforge.net/p/ibmswtpm2/tpm2/ci/master/tree/LICENSE
  https://sourceforge.net/p/ibmswtpm2/tpm2/ci/master/tree/src/LICENSE 

My commit moved to the base LICENSE file in the tree. The original recipe
pointed to the second LICENSE file under src/.

The original src/LICENSE appears to be a subset of the root LICENSE
but I can move the recipe back to the original src/LICENSE if that’s the
expected behavior here.

Looking at their changes, it looks like they appended or subtracted 
spaces  to various lines in that License file. Nothing other than noise.

They look like to different licenses, one has IBM in it the other does not.

Maybe list both and their sha's should address that.

This version supports openssl 3.1

The maintainer changed his tag versions hence the different looking
version.

The maintainer also has stopped releasing tar files and asked we
directly grab from git.
