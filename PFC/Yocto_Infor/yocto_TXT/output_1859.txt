Hello:

I'd like to build clinfo w/ "-g" option to do some debugging with GDB...

I am looking at: meta-openembedded/meta-oe/recipes-support/opencl/clinfo_2.2.18.04.06.bb

I created a "bbapend" file to modify the build recipes "Makefile.am" file prior to build, to introduce '-g' for CFLAGS & CPPFLAGS, i.e. at top of Makefile.am added:

                AM_CFLAGS - -g
                AM_CPPFLAGS = -g

I checked the build tree and see my modified "Makefile.am" updated as expected, the update occurs at the end of the install process, using do_install_append... so the build should have used my modified file... but I do not have symbols for the clinfo package when I go to use GDB.

Is there a simple way to enable debug symbols for this package ?

Did I modify the wrong configuration file?, Should I be modifying configure ?

I am new to auto-build configurations...
Could someone tell me the easiest way to add "-g" to the clinfo standard build ?

Thanks,
Steve
