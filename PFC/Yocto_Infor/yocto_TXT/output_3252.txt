Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.4 M1 has been through QA pending release approval with two QA
issues highlighted.
*	YP 3.1.9 is being built ready for QA.
*	Big thanks to Paul Gortmaker for tracking down the cause of an LTP
null pointer dereference (and other errors) within the cgroups mount code
which was responsible for several of our LTP hangs. The issue was introduced
in new code between 5.0 and 5.1 in the kernel and had been present for a
while. The fix is now making its way through various kernel trees upstream.
*	Sadly, the above fix did not resolve the "rcu" autobuilder VM hangs
we are seeing occasionally. These are odd in that they affect kvm and
non-kvm builds (x86 and arm seen on x86-64 hosts), they pin the VM at
300-400% CPU usage and the VM will respond to pings but no ssh or console
output. The rcu dumps from the kernel are likely a symptom that something is
wrong rather than the cause and often look incomplete. It is as if some
instantaneous host load breaks timers in a way the guest cannot recover or
continue execution from. We're continuing to try and narrow this down but it
is proving elusive and progress is slow, any insight anyone may have would
be welcome.
*	There are new manual sections that have recently been added on
<http://docs.yoctoproject.org/test-manual/reproducible-builds.html>
Reproducible Builds and
<http://docs.yoctoproject.org/test-manual/yocto-project-compatible.html>
Yocto Project Compatible.
*	We continue to deal with an issue with centos8 kernels having what
looks like bad bounds checking on the utimensat_time64 32 bit syscalls where
the syscall was backported into a kernel point release. We're working on
reporting it upstream.
*	We have a 10th anniversary T-shirt and some other Yocto Project
items (hoody, stickers, mugs etc.) now available at
<https://yoctoproject.org/shop> https://yoctoproject.org/shop (EU and
Americas sources)
*	The multiconfig changes in bitbake continue to cause problems, we
still need simpler test cases to reproduce issues rather than huge builds.
The existing patches seem to fix some workloads and break others. Richard is
trying to fix but trying to fix autobuilder issues and other problems and
these are slow builds to debug.
*	Intermittent autobuilder issues continue to occur and continue to be
at record high levels. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We are working to identify the load pattern on the infrastructure that seems
to trigger these.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
