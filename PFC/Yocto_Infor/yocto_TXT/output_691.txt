Hi,

What recipes should I use in IMAGE_INSTALL to install all of Rust and toolchains things for it on my target ARM board? What Yocto release was started to support Rust? Is ti possbile a make an SDK image with a Rust cross compiler like it is possible with GCC via mingw for Windows 10?

That's not a very specific question but there is:

meta/recipes-core/packagegroups/packagegroup-self-hosted.bb

Rust is not in that list yet and I suspect most people are not ready to 
add it either.
Once (if?) the kernel requires Rust, then we'll cha

Started in  honister:

❯ git log --reverse --oneline  --grep  rust: | head -1
61e1570c6a rust: initial merge of most of meta-rust

poky.git on master-next [$]
❯ git branch -a --contains 61e1570c6a
   honister
   kirkstone
   kirkstone-next
   langdale
   master
* master-next
   mickledore

but there were significant improvements in Aug 2022 and later,
specifically the ability to put the rust toolchain on the target MACHINE.

Likely but I'm not aware of anyone having done that.

Please let us know if you try it and if it works.
If it's important to you, a test case might be useful.
