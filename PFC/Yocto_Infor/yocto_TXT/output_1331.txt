Hi all.

I'd like to explod a tar file into subdirectory of source file.


The recipe fetch the original source from a git repos.

I make a tar of folder I'd like to add to the original sources.


SRC_URI := "\
     git://git.myserver.com/project.git \
     file://added_folder.tar \
"

# S is ${WORKDIR}/git


Now added_folder.tar is exploded in ${WORKDIR} but I'd like to explod it 
in ${WORKDIR}/git


There is some parameter for file:// fetcher?


Best regards,

   MZ
