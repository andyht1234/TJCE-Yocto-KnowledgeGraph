Hi,

I am struggling to add a device tree overlay to the linux kernel.

I am on the kirkstone branch and my recipe (linux-raspberrypi_%.bbappend) looks like this:

SRC_URI += "file://my_gpio.dts;subdir=git/arch/${ARCH}/boot/dts/overlays"

FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/deviceTree:"

PACKAGE_ARCH = "${MACHINE_ARCH}"

KERNEL_DEVICETREE:append = " overlays/my_gpio.dtbo"

In the build/deploy/images folder I can see the generated dtbo file but it not copied into /boot/overlays

Does anyone know what I am doing wrong ? Thanks..

Hi Daniel,

adding it to IMAGE_BOOT_FILES should do the trick.

Greetz,
Josef
