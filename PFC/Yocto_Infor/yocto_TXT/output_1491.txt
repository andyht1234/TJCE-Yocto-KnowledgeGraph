Hi community,

I'm wondering how to manage the bootloader files contents in a X86_64 machine and if those files have a relation with the WKS.in file.

By doing a bitbake -e <my_image> I can't figure out which variables are involved into the bootimg-efi.py (./poky/scripts/lib/wic/plugins/source/bootimg-efi.py), which recipe call or start this scripts and the ENV variables used by the script.

The main goal is to rename "title boot" by anything else without having to add a recipe to replace the boot file at the do_rootfs stage.

Any information/instructions will be appreciated and I didn't find any information into the MEGA Manual on this topic.  I'm probably blind 😁😁

BR,

Martin
