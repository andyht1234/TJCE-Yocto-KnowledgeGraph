Hi all.
I'm coding my own keyboard for a touch screen device based on Qt/Qml 5.6.
I'd like to implement a chinese input method.
The keyboard is embedded in the software and it is activated only inside the software.

The system is based on an old mix of Jethro/Krogoth
I know there ibus framework for this, but it is not included in yocto bsp.
Any idea about?
Best regards,
MZ

Hi Mauro,

You might have to add the meta-gnome layer or copy the recipe into your
own layer:

https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/recipe/112490/

Let us know how that works for you.

Hi Maruo,

Fcitx recipes are provided as meta-inputmethod from Clear-Code Inc.

https://gitlab.com/clear-code/meta-inputmethod

In addition, we, Cybertrust Japan, have recipes of fcitx-chewing,
fcitx-hangul and fcitx-m17n.

However, we need several company internal processes to contribute them
to public.

Would you have time to wait for them?
