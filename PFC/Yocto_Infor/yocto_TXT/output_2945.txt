We don't use the CD/DVD ROM drive in any of our tests, but it
periodically fails discovery and that leads to a QA error:

    [    6.403477] ata3.00: failed to IDENTIFY (I/O error, err_mask=0x4)

The only way to disable the optical ROM drive in qemu is to use
the '-nodefaults' option, which disables the CDROM (among other things).
We can't be sure that none of our tests, or extended users are relying
on default devices, so using that option is more of a risk than adding
the message to our ignore list.

To date, no one has sent a patch to just disable the optical drive
(either in qemu or the BIOS), but that is something we could consider
in the future.

[YOCTO #14528]
