Hello,

I am trying to generate configured sources archives using the archiver class but it fails when generating the initramfs image:

ERROR: core-image-minimal-initramfs-1.0-r0 do_rootfs: The file /usr/lib/i686-poky-linux/9.3.0/libgcc.a is installed by both libgcc and libgcc-initial, aborting

I am building on dunfell with these lines in the local.conf:
INITRAMFS_IMAGE = "core-image-minimal-initramfs"
INHERIT += "archiver"
ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "configured"

It works when generating the patched source archives. Should I define something else to make the configured source archive work ?

Thanks.
Sebastien
