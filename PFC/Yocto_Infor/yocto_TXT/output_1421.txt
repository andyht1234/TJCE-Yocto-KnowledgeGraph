Hello.
I developing now custom CM4 based board. For speed-up development I test software on RPi4 with external connection to development plates (2 CAN HAT, MAX98357 board)
To make work MAX98357 I need blacklist snd-bcm2835 and add custom asound.conf (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-max98357-i2s-class-d-mono-amp/raspberry-pi-usage)
What I try:
1. I add this lines to local.conf
KERNEL_MODULE_PROBECONF += " snd-bcm2835"
module_conf_snd_bcm2835 = "blacklist snd-bcm2835"
This doesn't helps. I see snd-bcm2835.conf on my filesystem after build.
2. I make "hack" of meta-boot2qt/meta-boot2qt-distro/conf/distro/include/raspberrypi.inc and delete snd-bcm2835 from KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "snd-bcm2835 bcm2835-v4l2" line
This works partially- I haven't now snd-bcm2835.conf but also haven't blacklist it.
3. I try to add custom asound.conf and create such https://github.com/Kuzma30/meta-myconf/blob/main/recipes-bsp/alsa-state/alsa-state.bbappend
Results - no /etc/asound.conf and /etc/asound-rpi4.conf on filesystem

Please help resolve my problem.
