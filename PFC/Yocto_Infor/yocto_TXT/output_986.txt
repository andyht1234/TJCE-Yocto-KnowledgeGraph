For the month of January 2023, the distribution of dd times has a long
tail that extends to 13 seconds with 2 events exceeding the current
limit of 30 seconds.

Reduce the timeout to 3 seconds based on the observed distribution of
dd times, which would result in the timout triggering about 20 times a month.
That's enough data to be useful but not so much that it's overwhelming the
logging or the people who will analyze it. It also avoids the rapid increase
in the tail of the distribution which starts to rise exponentially under 2 seconds.
It's sensible response time for people to expect the system to have.
