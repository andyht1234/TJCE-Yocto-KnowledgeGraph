Hi all.

I'd like to add a script to my recipes which collect all licenses for 
all directly shared linked libraries.


My recipe build the main application of the system and I need to enum 
every library used by my application and for each library get the license.


I try to look inside DEPENDS variable but there other references then 
libraries


Any idea?


Best regards,

 Â  MZ

When you build an image you get a license manifest in tmp/deploy/licenses, this should contain all the information you want.
