Hello World,

I'm trying to install an extensible SDK of `core-image-minimal` on a
system different from the build system (build system is Debian 10,
install system is e.g. Ubuntu 20.04). When doing this, the following
error occurs:

```
ERROR: Task
(virtual:native:/home/test/poky_sdk/layers/poky/meta/recipes-devtools
/pseudo/pseudo_git.bb:do_fetch) failed with exit code 'setscene whitelist'
```

The full log file `preparing_build_system.log` is available at:
https://pastebin.com/m9KmshY0

It seems `recipes-devtools/pseudo/pseudo_git.bb` does depend on the
build environment and therefore yields different hashes which results in
broken sstate-cache. Does someone know what exactly went wrong and how
to fix it?

Steps to reproduce:

Use the following `kas-project.yml`:

```yml
header:
  version: 10
machine: qemux86-64
distro: poky
local_conf_header:
  standard: |
    CONF_VERSION = "1"
    PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_rpm"
repos:
  poky:
    url: "https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky"
    refspec: dunfell
    layers:
      meta:
      meta-poky:
      meta-yocto-bsp:
```

Then, run a kas container (https://github.com/siemens/kas, e.g. use
`kas-container` script): `./kas-container shell kas-project.yml` This
will start a Debian 10 container with kas installed.

Build the extensible SDK with `bitbake -c populate_sdk_ext
core-image-minimal`.

After finishing, install the extensible SDK on a different machine (for
testing purposes e.g. in a Docker container for example `ubuntu:20.04`).
It will result in the error mentioned above.

How do I fix that?

Thanks in advance!

Hendrik
