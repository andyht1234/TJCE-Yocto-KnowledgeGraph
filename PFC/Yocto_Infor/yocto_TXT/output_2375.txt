I build the image with the command

#bitbake phytec-headless-image

then I need to add something to the image and I do it like this

#rm -rf tmp sstate-cache deploy

and

#bitbake phytec-headless-image

but this is too long, the question is: what to remove , so as not to
rebuild all the packages, but so that the package was added to the
image, for example, I modified local.conf, it was like this:
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = "mbpoll mosquitto"
it became like this
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = "mbpoll mosquitto ntp ntpdate rsyslog"

Do not remove sstate cache, it is there specifically so that you do not
have to rebuild all the packages.
