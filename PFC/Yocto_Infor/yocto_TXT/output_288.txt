I have a ramdomize problem on local ssh git repository.
The git server is on the PC where i am using YOCTO
The git repository belong to an another user  (git) than bitbake user (ame).

DISTRO = "poky"
DISTRO_NAME = "Poky (Yocto Project Reference Distro)"
DISTRO_VERSION = "4.2"
DISTRO_CODENAME = "mickledore"

example:
git -c gc.autoDetach=false -c core.pager=cat ls-remote ssh://git@maison/home/git/bleconnect.git  failed with exit code 128, output: kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
In my bitbake terminal console, i can try this command many times without any problem.
with bitbake build image, i have a very hazardous and common problem and  on different local git depository recipe.

The recipe syntax is
SRCREV="${AUTOREV}"
SRCBRANCH = "master"
PV = "1.0-1+git${SRCPV}"
S = "${WORKDIR}/git"
SRC_URI = "git://git@maison/home/git/bleconnect.git;branch=master;protocol=ssh \
"
This problem recently appears and I had no problem before. I generate image for this project for years.
But its appear recently. I have done some POKY  update. (raspberry)
Do you know the problem ?
Is there a solution .
Thanks.
