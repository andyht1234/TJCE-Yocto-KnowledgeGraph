The upstream kernel reorganized the 32-bit arch/arm device-tree directory structure
to separate out the device-trees by manufacturer (similar to the organization
of the arch/arm64 device-trees). Update the references to 32-bit arm
device-trees to match.

Does this work with linux-yocto and linux-yocto-dev from master or do we 
need to add some logic to support both (do you want to?).

Cheers,

This doesn't work at all. I figured this was an easy one, made the tweak,
submitted it, then added it to my jenkins builder to verify overnight. Woke up
to find the do_image_wic() tasks failed. It's the same layout as the 64-bit
machines but I'll have to dig in to figure out why it didn't work.

As for the linux-yocto vs linux-yocto-dev question I'll take a look. This
happened with linux-yocto, so I would assume it is already the case with
linux-yocto-dev. But if oe-core supports multiple versions of linux-yocto,
that might be the tricky bit and yes, I would look into supporting both for
the time-being until the transition period ends.

Although... any BSP layer supporting 32-bit machines will have similar issues,
so perhaps there's a better way to solve this in oe-core?

Best regards,
	Trevor

This was done in v6.5-rc1 so anything before won't work sadly.

master branch of poky supports 6.1 6.4 and 6.5 for linux-yocto 
(linux-yocto-dev being typically newer than the latest linux-yocto and 
the latest linux-yocto already having the change, I'll omit the change 
for linux-yocto-dev).

For reference, denix on IRC suggested you look at 
https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/commit/?id=04ab57d20009d85eb566e83ae6fe1dcea4db7300 
for what we're trying to do here. But I think this isn't applying to how 
the DTB is found but rather where it's put and this is too late for us.

I think we need to modify get_real_dtb_path_in_kernel in 
meta/classes-recipe/kernel-devicetree.bbclass instead.

We could handle it this way for example to allow a fallback:
"""
get_real_dtb_path_in_kernel:arm () {
	dtb="$1"
	dtb_path="${B}/arch/${ARCH}/boot/dts/$dtb"
         # Handle pre-v6.5 layout for Aarch32/ARM DTB
	if [ ! -e "$dtb_path" ]; then
		dtb_path="${B}/arch/${ARCH}/boot/dts/$(basename "$dtb")"
	fi
	if [ ! -e "$dtb_path" ]; then
		dtb_path="${B}/arch/${ARCH}/boot/$dtb"
	fi
         # Handle pre-v6.5 layout for Aarch32/ARM DTB
	if [ ! -e "$dtb_path" ]; then
		dtb_path="${B}/arch/${ARCH}/boot/$(basename "$dtb")"
	fi

	echo "$dtb_path"
}
"""
(to be determined if "arm" is a valid OVERRIDES, otherwise we need to 
check against "ARCH" bb variable; also not sure about the second 
basename if it's necessary at all).

Then you would just have KERNEL_DEVICETREE done the same way as in this 
patch:
KERNEL_DEVICETREE = "rockchip/rk3066a-marsboard.dtb"

and we wouldn't have to handle it on the recipe level.

Otherwise, we could do the following:
RK_KERNEL_DEVICETREE = "rockchip/rk3066a-marsboard.dtb"
KERNEL_DEVICETREE ?= "${RK_KERNEL_DEVICETREE}"

then have a bbappend for all old-layout recipes:
linux-yocto-rt_6.1.bbappend
linux-yocto-tiny_6.1.bbappend
linux-yocto_6.1.bbappend
linux-yocto-rt_6.4.bbappend
linux-yocto-tiny_6.4.bbappend
linux-yocto_6.4.bbappend

KERNEL_DEVICETREE:arm = "${@' '.join(os.path.basename(dtb) for dtb in 
d.getVar('RK_KERNEL_DEVICETREE').split())}"

or something like that. We probably want to have something a bit more 
precise than just arm to avoid breaking other arm machine conf files 
which do not define RK_KERNEL_DEVICETREE, maybe 
KERNEL_DEVICETREE:rockchip:arm if that is even resolving properly.

Adding Bruce in Cc, I hope he doesn't mind being summoned like this. 
Maybe you have an idea on how to handle both the new and old layout for 
ARM/Aarch32 DTB in the kernel for the KERNEL_DEVICETREE variable?

Cheers,
Quentin

My last run in with this may have been before some of the most recent
device tree handling patches, and/or I may have been doing it wrong.

But my solution was to simply override the variable in a kernel version
specific bbappend, and not do it in the conf files.

But of course, if that variable is being interpreted by a different class in
the global namespace, then the kernel bbappend approach isn't going
to work anymore.

I've stayed away from utilities or searching, etc, rather just a way for the
configuration to specify directly what to find, as anything that searches
ends up being fragile.

The biggest tangle is that the master branch supports 6.1, 6.4, and 6.5.
Getting something to work with one version at at time isn't hard; getting it
to work simultaneously with all 3 (and others?) is the tricky part.

In a perfect world we could have linux-kernel-version-specific machine conf
sections/files... but that would be crazy!

I've been poking at this from different angles off-and-on for the last couple
days. The more I look at it, the more I like what meta-ti-bsp did. That's
probably what I'm going to do:

conf/machine/MACHINE.conf file has:
- KERNEL_DEVICETREE that just lists the bare dtb file (without directories)
- KERNEL_DEVICETREE_PREFIX that lists possible directory names

recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto% bbappends have logic to check combinations
of KERNEL_DEVICETREE_PREFIX+KERNEL_DEVICETREE to find the actual dtb.

Something probably also needs to be added to IMAGE_BOOT_FILES so wic works
too.

NOTE: given that this is meta-rockchip, the KERNEL_DEVICETREE_PREFIX could
simply be known to be "rockchip" a-priori; it doesn't necessarily need to be
that flexible.

And the real catch is that this is only a problem today because a specific OE
branch has both pre- and post- cleanup kernel versions. If the OE branches
didn't mix the two, this wouldn't be a problem. And someday once master has
moved away from having both pre- and post- cleanup kernel versions, we can
throw all this infrastructure out (on master) going forward.

Best regards,
	Trevor
