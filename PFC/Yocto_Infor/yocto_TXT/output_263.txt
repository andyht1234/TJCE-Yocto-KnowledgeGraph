I am reaching out with an inquiry pertaining to the utilization of the Extensible Software Development Kit (ESDK). After successfully generating the core-image-minimal through the command

```bitbake core-image-minimal -c populate_sdk_ext```

I proceeded to install the ESDK. At present, I find myself faced with a query regarding the installation of an application characterized by dynamic link library dependencies.

My objective is twofold: I aim to both construct and deploy this application. However, a notable challenge has emerged. My uncertainty lies in the process of building and deploying the application, specifically with a focus on dynamic linking, without resorting to static linking. My intention is for the libraries to be seamlessly integrated within the "/usr/lib" and "/usr/include" directories, while the application itself finds its place within the "/usr/bin" directory. It is of utmost importance that the application maintains dynamic links to the requisite libraries, as opposed to relying on static links.

app directory:
CMakeLists.txt
main.c (#include <stdio.h> #include <mylib.h>)

mylib directory:

CMakeLists.txt

src : mylib.h mylib.c

I humbly request your expert guidance in navigating this aspect of the project. Your insights and expertise would be instrumental in steering me towards a successful resolution.

Thank you profoundly for your valuable time and consideration. I eagerly await your guidance and counsel on this matter.

With utmost respect,

Mahdi

Actually, I don't know if I should change the content of CMakeLists.txt or should I use a special command (like devtool or ...)?
