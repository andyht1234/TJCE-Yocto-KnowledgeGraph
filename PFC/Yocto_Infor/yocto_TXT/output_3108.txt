Hi guys,

i am running yocto (with IMX BSP gatesgarth-5.10.9-1.0.0) inside docker and am getting the below issue which i though to be already fixed by https://patchwork.openembedded.org/patch/174423/.
File "/home/dev/my-yocto/build/tmp/work/imx8mn_bat_bs4_dev-poky-linux/my-image/1.0-r0/recipe-sysroot-native/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/bmaptools/Filemap.py", line 238, in _probe_seek_hole ##[error]#15 18105.0 raise ErrorNotSupp("the file-system does not support "SEEK_HOLE" and "SEEK_DATA" but only provides a stub implementation

Obviously the file "Filemap.py" getting used is the one downloaded via the bmap-tools recipe. It does not contain the fix linked above.
./build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/bmap-tools-native/3.5+gitAUTOINC+a17f0e3ff8-r0/sysroot-destdir/home/<...>/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/bmap-tools-native/3.5+gitAUTOINC+a17f0e3ff8-r0/recipe-sysroot-native/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/bmaptools/Filemap.py
Why does it not take the one from sources/poky/scripts/lib/wic/filemap.py which does have the desired fix ?

Any pointer / hint is appreciated.

Thanks and Regards,
Jonas
