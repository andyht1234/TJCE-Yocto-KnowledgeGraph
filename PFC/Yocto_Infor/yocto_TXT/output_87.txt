Hello,

I am looking for guidance on enabling uart5 on raspberrypi 4B board. I have added ENABLE_UART = 1 in local.conf. I have successfully build kirkstone branch and booted successfully. Even i am able to see the consol on default uart channel.

I nowÂ  would like enable the urat5 on raspberry pi 4b and add simple c/python code to transmit test data through raspberry board. Mainly i am looking for steps how to map this uart5 to tty , how to configure tty and How use tty to send data on uart5 channel.

Thank You,
Amol
