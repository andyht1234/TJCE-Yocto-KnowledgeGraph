Hello everyone.

I want to speed up my production build, by preventing from removing -native, nativesdk- and -cross- packages.
For now, I clean all by removing tmp, sstate-cache, and some other folders (rm -rf /tmp /sstate-cache...).
Maybe, it is possible to split TMPDIR, SSTATE_DIR, to place native packages in other folders, than nonnative packages.
Or place all prebuild -native, nativesdk- and -cross- packages to SSTATE_MIRRORS.

Any proposition on how can I make this best?

Ivan.

Do not remove sstate-cache. It's there specifically to make builds
faster by reusing existing build outputs, and is designed to be
reusable between any build configuration.
Removing tmp is fine.
