The last kernel to not split the rock-pi-4[abc] MACHINEs into separate
device trees was 5.10. The linux-yocto kernels supported in this release
are all after 5.10. Therefore remove the rock-pi-4 MACHINE. By now, on master,
everyone should be selecting specific MACHINEs from one of the variants and
not using "rock-pi-4".

NOTE: this layer will continue to use "rock-pi-4" as a MACHINEOVERRIDE when
      the specific variant doesn't matter
