Alex, Jose,

I could not find documentation how to handle mixins layer.
Could you please pick this to kirkstone/go meta-lts-mixins?
Or should I send a patch to yocto@lists.yoctoproject.org (or other mailing list) instead of asking for a cherry-pick?

Thanks,
  Peter

Either is ok, but a patch is usually better because it can be quickly
applied and pushed. kirkstone/go is handled by Jose, not me.

Hi,

I will cherry-pick it tomorrow.
Thanks for the reminder.
