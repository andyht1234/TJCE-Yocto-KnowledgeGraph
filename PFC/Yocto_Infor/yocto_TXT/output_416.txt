Putting that unconditionally in a layer.conf is a pretty poor thing to
do for usability IMO as it effectively forces that decision on anyone
including the layer. There has to be a better way to handle that, at
least conditionally on some override?

Cheers,

Richard

Yep. I moved it and the other qemu params to the image instead. That 
patch has not been sent.

Currently these belong logically to machine config but what about generic
machine targets. Could an image config define how much memory is needed
to run the image on qemu?

Cheers,

I believe Armin did move these to the image recipe which is what we do
in core in some cases for this too. I think that makes more sense.

$ git grep -l  QB_MEM
classes-recipe/baremetal-image.bbclass
classes-recipe/qemuboot.bbclass
recipes-core/images/build-appliance-image_15.0.0.bb
recipes-core/images/core-image-ptest.bb
recipes-graphics/images/core-image-weston-sdk.bb

recipes-graphics/images/core-image-x11.bb

Yes, you can set that in an image recipe.
