Key Status/Updates:

   -

   We are now two weeks away from feature freeze for 4.3.
   -

   YP 3.1.27 was released
   -

   YP 4.0.12 is in QA.
   -

   The 6.4 kernel upgrade is still blocked as we’ve seen two nasty looking
   hangs in automated testing:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/148/builds/349/steps/12/logs/stdio

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/148/builds/354/steps/12/logs/stdio

as well as a preempt-rt boot error that appears more consistently:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/72/builds/7616/steps/36/logs/stdio

The intermittent issues are a significant risk to automated testing
stability and it is hard to know how to proceed as few people are
willing/able to help with them. We’ve upgraded qemu 8.0.3 -> 8.0.4 just in
case that helps.

   -

   The various systemd issues have mostly been resolved although the AUH
   did break as a result and will have to be fixed and rerun.
   -

   Build layout changed slightly with the removal of PE and PR from the
   WORKDIR path.
   -

   There are patches pending which remove source control revisions from PV
   and move them to PKGV, further simplifying WORKDIR paths and generally
   improving the code and the way AUTOREV works. This allows SRCPV to be
   removed as it is no longer needed.
   -

   Significant fixes were made to both the binutils and gcc testsuites
   which avoid many of the mips toolchain test failures. The failure counts
   are roughly the same (few hundred) for each architecture now resulting in
   ~3200 failures overall.
   -

   There are now consistently ~200 ltp ‘controllers’ failures on both arm
   and x86 targets.
   -

   A new uninative version was released to add some patches to patchelf to
   avoid bugs.
   -

   A new test addition to oe-selftest caused another test to fail
   consistently on the autobuilder and this has been tracked down to one test
   corrupting the other if they run in the same TMPDIR. This only happens with
   specific parallelism settings where they happen to run together or with no
   parallelism.
   -

   We continue to see intermittent ptest failures for glib-networking,
   mdadm and openssh, help would be much appreciated.
   -

   CVE metrics are worrying with significant numbers of open CVEs against
   master, many of them kernel related. The 6.4 upgrade should help but that
   is blocked. Mickledore is also badly affected with a record high count.

Ways to contribute:

   -

   As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which
   are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to
   keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool,
   toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many
   have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
   components!
   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.

   We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
   appreciated.

I sent the patch now - it's for yocto-autobuilder-helper, not AUH, so
when that's applied, AUH job can re-run.
