Add a MACHINE definition for the FriendlyElec NanoPi R2S
https://www.friendlyelec.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=284

My testing shows that there still seems to be some issues with the SDcard
voltage regulator. The kernel has a number of fix attempts for this issue, but
I've seen it a couple times. Ejecting and re-inserting the SDcard gets past
the issue. Some SDcards show the issue, others don't.

Nice catch, thanks! :-)

Turns out the SDcard issue I was seeing was bizarre too, I have many cards
lying around, out of pure luck the 2 I tried were bad, all the rest are
fine.

However, I did find a patch for a soft-reboot SDcard issue that seems to
help.

I'll be sending a v2 when I cycle back around to it.
