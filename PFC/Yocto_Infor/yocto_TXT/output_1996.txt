Hello All,

I am an experienced Yocto engineer, and I want to contribute to Yocto project (bitbake core, poky layers, etc) but I do not know what to contribute or is there a TODO list that I can help with.

Besides, I have some classes that I can contribute to poky, but I do not know where to commit it.

Can anyone help me.

Thanks in advance.
Talel

I think you can look through Bugzilla for unassigned tasks [1], for example.

This one should help on commiting [2]. You should send patches to the
relevant mailing list [3]. For the core, it should be the 
openembedded-core list [4].

Thanks for the guide.

I have one more question regarding the bugs. I noticed that there is a Zoom meeting link ( https://zoom.us/postattendee?mn=wVY4wgNvql1k1Mrzj4NVPellZN1oQQHGWA.fjPvBIH_i1IT6GdY&id=6 ) , do I need to join it and participate in a discussion about the tasks assignments and try to get a bug assigned to me in order to start working on it ?

I know that is quite difficult for me to understand the contribution flow for the moment.

Thanks,
Talel

 You are welcome to attend any of the public Yocto developers meetings, if
nothing else you will meet and hear directly from the core developers.
However it's not strictly required. Anyone is free to start contributing.
You can work either on items that are already in our Bugzilla, or work on
things that are important to you too. If you pick up a task from Bugzilla,
it's a good practice to engage on the bugzilla bug and tell them that you
want to work on it, so that everyone is aware of it.

We have a special category of bugs which we mark for NEWCOMER. They are
usually non critical items, and often 'simple' so that they are suitable
for new developers starting with Yocto. See

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers

Our contribution process is to send patches onto mailing lists, where they
are reviewed/discussed and eventually picked up by the relevant
maintainers. You can keep asking questions here, if you need more
assistance to send your first contributions!
