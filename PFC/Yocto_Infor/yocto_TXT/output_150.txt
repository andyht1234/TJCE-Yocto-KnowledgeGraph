Hi all,

In the scope of the RFQ, I am currently looking at bug #14737 (adding
support of PEP-517 in recipetool/devtool).

I am quite new to the recipetool/devtool tools and I have several
ideas I would like to discuss before going into development that may
not be appropriate/necessary for the tool.

As of today, from what I understand (please correct me if I am wrong)
'devtool add' supports the creation of recipes for python modules from
their download tarball so something like: devtool add
https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e4/29/f1e7113ca4632283a76cdbe40b62be860d268fdc0e8eab7216ffaf2aa0ef/subunit-0.0.0a0.tar.gz
works, but:
- the created recipe does NOT takes advantage of the pypi class: the
created recipe will have the SRC_URI variable instead of using
'inherit pypi'
- user has to find the url of the tarball

I think it would be really easier for the user to just use: 'devtool
add https://pypi.org/project/subunit/' This will have several
advantages:
- easier to use
- fetch latest version automatically
- easy to fetch specific version with --version
- can easily detect 'pypi.org' on the url and inherit pypi
- can easily parse the webpage for several informations such as
author, summary, homepage, bugtracker page .. (I know some of them can
be extracted from  setup.py / pyproject.toml, but not always)

Looking at the create_recipe function of
scripts/lib/recipetool/create.py, we can see that code is really git
oriented even if you use a tarball, you go through a bunch of 'if'
that doesn't apply.

I think we can modernize this part of the code. This would also be
useful for perl modules and cpan or rust modules and cargo...

What do you think? Is this something that is worth investigating and
implementing?

Cheers
Julien

Basically... yes, this is fine.

We don't really have anyone taking care of devtool/recipetool at the
moment or even knowing how the code works, so you have a lot of
freedom in how it can be improved, the only request from me is to add
tests to devtool and/or recipetool selftests for any new functionality
or otherwise improve tests as deemed necessary (it's a good idea to
study what there is right now - they're in
meta/lib/oeqa/selftest/cases/).

Basically, yes, it sounds like the right direction to me. Even nicer
might be:

devtool add pypi subunit

which might match well other possible options like:

devtool add cpan <cpan module name>

and other such usages.

This would take a bit more work up front to implement since it would be
in the form "<type> <name>" rather than the existing "<url>" but that
is probably worth investing in.

As Alex mentioned, unit tests are key to keeping this maintainable. We
do have really good test suites for recipetool and devtool already so
we need to ensure new functionality has good coverage.

Cheers,

Richard

Hi Alexandre and Richard,

Nice, I will try to come up with something and post it as RFC.

I will take care of adding selftests.

"devtool add pypi subunit" looks good, I will try to look at this

Cheers
Julien
