Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.2 rc3 has passed QA and is pending TSC approval for release.
*	YP 4.1.4 is now in QA.
*	Patches are merging into master for 4.3.
*	Emails to all currently listed maintainers have been sent to check
the entries are up to date. If anyone is interested in taking on maintenance
of any unassigned recipes, please send a patch.
*	We discovered warnings were not being correctly handled on the
autobuilder after the buildbot controller upgrade. That should now be fixed
but it means some regressions may have crept in, we're working to confirm if
that is the case or not.
*	We're in the process of adding checks to ensure that ptests
returning no test results trigger warnings. This should ensure we catch this
situation earlier since ptests should always return at least one test
result. python3-cryptography is an example of a recipe that recently
regressed unnoticed in this way.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components
which are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying
to keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex,
devtool, toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more.
Many have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
components!
*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
*	Help us resolve CVE issues:
<https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/patchmetrics/> CVE metrics 
*	We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.
