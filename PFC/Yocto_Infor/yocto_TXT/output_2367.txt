Hi,

I'm new to yocto. I write a reciple for my own package. The source
code of package is in my PC and maintained by GIT. When I change the
source code of the package, I need to compile this package again with
"bitbake -c clean package" and "bitbake -c compile package".
However, even though I can see the code in the folder
downloads/git2/package.git is updated, but bitbake still use the last
commit of the git repo to compile. After debugging, I found the old
commit ID is stored in build-project/cache/bb_persist_data.sqlite3. Is
this normal?
Is it caused by my own wrong reciple or is there any command to clean
the cache for a package? Thank you!

Tony

In theory, there's no need to run 'bitbake -c clean'. Did you update the SRCREV? It would be easier if you could share some info of your recipe.

Qi

Thanks a lot. This is root cause. I did not update the SRCREV because
I have not added this SRCREV in my recipe.
