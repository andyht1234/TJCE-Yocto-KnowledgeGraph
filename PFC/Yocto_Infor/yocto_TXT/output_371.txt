Hi.

I want to use mkfs.ext4 in my recipe. I found that in meta/classes-recipe/image_types.bbclass , line 96 contains "mkfs.ext4 -d" option to create ext4 image from a directory ($IMAGE_ROOTFS).

I'd like to know if it's possible to use this "-d" option in my recipe. I can call "/sbin/mkfs.ext4", but it does not support "-d".

Thanks in advance.

Your host’s mkfs.ext4 is too old, depend on e2fsprogs-native and you can use the newer mkfs.ext4 that we build.
