Hello, I  writed a conf file  to get the raspberrypi0-2 to work in 32 mode
to have the camera packages raspivid. It works just fine. But the problem I
don't have wlan0 interface. I tried everything but I didn't succeed in
getting to work. Here is my conf file:

#@TYPE: Machine
#@NAME: RaspberryPi0 2 Wifi Development Board
#@DESCRIPTION: Machine configuration for the RaspberryPi0 2 Wifi in 32 bits
mode

include conf/machine/raspberrypi3.conf

MACHINEOVERRIDES := "${@'${MACHINEOVERRIDES}'
.replace(':${MACHINE}',':raspberrypi3:${MACHINE}')}"

MACHINE_EXTRA_RRECOMMENDS += "\
    linux-firmware-rpidistro-bcm43436 \
    linux-firmware-rpidistro-bcm43436s \
    bluez-firmware-rpidistro-bcm43430b0-hcd \
    linux-firmware-rpidistro-bcm43430 \
"




Best regards,

    "
