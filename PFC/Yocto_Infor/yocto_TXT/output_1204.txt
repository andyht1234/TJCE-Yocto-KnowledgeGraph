Hello,

I am working on kirkstone. If UBOOT_ENV is specified and kernel-fitimage is in KERNEL_CLASSES, boot script section is not added in the fitimage.

In fitimage_assemble (kernel-fitimage.bbclass), the 3 rd step is not performed because boot directory is not in STAGING_DIR_HOST. Indeed, u-boot.inc installs UBOOT_ENV_BINARY in boot directory but boot is not in SYSROOT_DIRS so it is not present in kernel STAGING_DIR_HOST.

Should we add the following line in u-boot.inc ?

SYSROOT_DIRS:append = "${@' /boot' if d.getVar('UBOOT_ENV') else ''}"

Best regards,
Sébastien Fabre

The logic seems reasonable to me, yes. We could have used the deploy 
directory instead and depend on the do_deploy task instead of the 
do_populate_sysroot but I think it is actually safer to use the sysroot 
(because it is cleaned if a dependency changes, as opposed to the deploy 
directory that might be providing an old version, e.g. think one build 
with UBOOT_ENV set followed by one it isn't, the deployed artifact will 
still be present).

Though, please use += instead of :append.

I'm wondering also if we cannot just always have /boot in SYSROOT_DIRS 
for U-Boot recipe? I guess it's fine like this :)

Please send a patch,
Cheers,
Quentin
