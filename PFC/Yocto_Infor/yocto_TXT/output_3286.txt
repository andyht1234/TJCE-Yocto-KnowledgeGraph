This is a RK3328 board from Pine64.
Board details at https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/ROCK64.

Default image is built to boot from SD-card.  Building an image for
eMMC requires to set RK_BOOT_DEVICE="mmcblk0".

This is just basic initial support without a kernel BSP.  As is the
board boots with a serial console.

Note I had to create the SoC definition for rk3328, and rather than
setting serial at 115200 there just to have the board definition
override it with rockchip-standard 1500000 I've set the latter right
in rk3328.inc.

Changes in v2:
- include Ayufan's patch for mmc aliases so presence of eMMC won't
prevent booting from SD

Sounds good. I prefer the rockchip default of 1,500,000 anyway.

Can you also specify an OSS-friendly licence too?

Personally I'd prefer to see a rock64 wic file which includes an rk3328
default, even if it is a copy of the rock-pi-4 layout.

I have a roc-rk3328-cc ("renegade") board I should investigate adding. Then I
can see if this applies there as well.

Oh, right, copypaste rules around here, so Garmin does have a role but
something may be missing :)

Right that was something I wondered how to deal with and forgot (and note that
for the nanopi-m4 I used the same file).

My reading of [1] is that all rockchip APs are using the same
partition table.  I see
that the existing {rk3288,rk3399}-boot.wks only differ in the choice
of u-boot image,
and I'm wondering if using the SoC to distinguish between them is the
right choice,
as eg. upstream RK is not using the .itb format, and I suspect we
could use it as well
for rk3288 (I'm sure I have one in a drawer and could check that some day).  Now
maybe the sate of things is different for 32bit SoCs, and I thought it
could make sense to
distinguish rockchip-32bit-boot.wks and rockchip-64bit-boot.wks, or maybe even
name them using the format, as something like rockchip-legacy-boot.wks
(well there
is probably a more descriptive name for that format) and rockchip-itb-boot.wks ?

Similarly, the .wks for 3288-based boards and for 3399-based ones only
differ by the
console baudrate, and the 3288-based .wks are all identical except for
some whitespace.
And in fact, it is not unthinkable for a given project to use
something else than a
single-partition layout, so those files are indeed closer to a
"default wks".  Maybe we
could use more generic filenames there too (until we implement a way to avoid
hardcoding the baudrate here)

True. We could definitely use some cleanup in this area. If you want to
propose something that's going to work, I'll add it.

Also, when adding a new board, please update the top-level README.

Thanks!

In fact we already have rock-pi-e.wks doing this.

Let's do the minimum for now for this to get merged, and we'll improve
incrementally.
Eg. only now I realize, through the presence of rk3328-boot.wks, that
rock-pi-e is
indeed also based on that soc, and its machine def would benefit from
including the
same rk3328.inc.
