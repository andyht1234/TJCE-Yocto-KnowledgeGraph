Hi,
I am new to yocto and have some problems by installing a SDK with yocto for AArch64.
The SDK you can find here: https://www.baumer.com/ch/de/produktubersicht/industriekameras-bildverarbeitung/software/baumer-gapi-sdk/linux-arm/c/14178

It comes with a debian package and a tar.gz file.
The tar is like this:
include/sdk-folder/header-files
lib/sdk-folder/lib-files
etc..

*Question 1: What is the best way to install this with yocto ?*

*1. I tried to install the deb package like this with no success:*

DEPENDS += " dpkg-native "

SRC_URI += " \
file://baumer-gapi-sdk-linux-v2.11.0-gcc-5.4-aarch64.deb.zip \
"

do_install_append() {
touch ${STAGING_DIR_NATIVE}/var/lib/dpkg/status
${STAGING_BINDIR_NATIVE}/dpkg --instdir=${D}/ \
--admindir=${STAGING_DIR_NATIVE}/var/lib/dpkg/ \
-i ${WORKDIR}/baumer-gapi-sdk-linux-v2.11.0-gcc-5.4-aarch64.deb
}
*Question 2: Is this a good way with dpkg, when host and target architecture are different ?*

*2. I tried to install the tar.gz file like this also with no sucess:*

# Use local tarball
SRC_URI = "file://${BP}.tar.gz"

S = "${WORKDIR}"

inherit bin_package

#For Error: libraries are added by mutiple providers
EXCLUDE_FROM_SHLIBS = "1"

#For Warning: was already stripped (precompiled sources)
INSANE_SKIP_${PN} = "ldflags"
INHIBIT_PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT = "1"
INHIBIT_PACKAGE_STRIP = "1"

do_install() {
cp -r "${WORKDIR}/include ${D}/include
...
}
The way I thought here, is to extract and copy each file to the target inside do_install..

*It would be very helpful when you could give me some hints for the best way to installing this package*
*Thanks*

Hi,

After you download e.g. the tarball, you'll find an installation guide 
inside.

It says:

OpenSUSE 13.1 / 42.3
Ubuntu Â® 14.04 / 16.04
Fedora 26 / 27
Debian 8.10 / 9.3

So I am not sure why you assume that this should work out of the box/at 
all with the Yocto Project.

If you really want it I suggest to talk to Baumer about it and I am 
happy to help you and them with the integration.

Regards,

Robert
