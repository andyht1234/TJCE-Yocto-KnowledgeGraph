Hi all,

I would like to configure my host to allow the yocto-built qemu guest access the internet. I'm running qemu with kvm virtualization and slirp, and according to [1] it should just work. I'd like to find out why it doesn't.

[1] https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Networking#User_Networking

Here's the current situation:

* The guest has ip 10.0.2.15 and can ping my host with `ping 10.0.2.2`.
* The host has no ip 10.0.0.0/16.
* The guest cannot ping my hosts only ipv4 interface (besides lo) `ping 192.168.178.24`.
* The guest cannot ping devices in the same LAN as my host: `ping 192.168.178.101`.
* The host has sysctl configured like so:

    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 1
    net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 1
    net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1

* The hosts routing table:

    Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
    0.0.0.0         192.168.178.1   0.0.0.0         UG    600    0        0 wlp3s0
    169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 wlp3s0
    192.168.178.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     600    0        0 wlp3s0

* runqemu starts qemu with hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22. That is, qemu is instructed to on the host listen on port 2222 and forward packets to port 22 of the guest.
* From the host I can ssh into the guest with `ssh root@localhost -p2222`.

When the ssh connection is up, `netstat -tupen` on the host prints

    Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       User       Inode      PID/Program name
    tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:2222          127.0.0.1:37548         ESTABLISHED 1000       34788      2301/qemu-system-x8 
    tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:37548         127.0.0.1:2222          ESTABLISHED 1000       40091      2331/ssh

`netstat -tuen` inside the guest prints

    Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       
    tcp        0      0 ::ffff:10.0.2.15:22     ::ffff:10.0.2.2:37548   ESTABLISHED


Has anyone any ideas?

Thanks, regards,
Manuel

Hello Manuel,

the last time I tried, I had to set the IP 192.168.7.2 and the gateway 192.168.7.1 in the guest.

Then everything worked through the tap device.

Best regards,
Matthias

Please note I'd like to use SLIRP instead of TAP as TAP needs root on the host.

But I guess I could just try it for once, just to see if it works...

Manuel

I hoped I could SLIRP for general internet connectivity to work by enabling NAT on the host. If I recall correctly, I could see the pings I sent from inside the qemu guest to 10.0.2.2 show up on my host, hence I assumed there is a chance. (I checked with wireguard.) With systemd-networkd NAT seems to be quite easy to set up: [1].
