Hi,

I’ve just released the first release of pkgexp, a tool to explore the pkgdata that has been generated in a build.  Quoting from the README:

pkgexp is a tool to visually explore the OpenEmbedded `pkgdata`, which is the generated package-scope metadata. Specifically, it is designed to answer common questions regarding what has been built:

- What recipes have been built?
- What packages did those packages build?
- What files are in a specific package?
- What other packages does this package depend on?
- What packages depend on this package?

It’s written in Python and is a local webapp (mainly because my build machine is remote, so little webapps make sense).

The code is at https://gitlab.com/rossburton/pkgexp, and positive feedback is welcome.

Cheers,
Ross

The immediate problem with that is that for some packages, like libc, the reverse depends list can be huuuuge.  If the page is redesigned to have scrollable regions then sure.  That would likely involve someone more skilled in web design than me getting involved ;)

Understood, this definitely makes sense. Forget it!
