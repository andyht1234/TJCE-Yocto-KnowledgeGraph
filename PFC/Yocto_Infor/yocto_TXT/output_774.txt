I'm trying to remove a series of packages from my yocto build but what I've tried hasn't worked so far. This is what I have:

```
PACKAGE_EXCLUDE += "\
avahi \
apt \
apt-native \
cmake \
cmake-native \
cracklib \
crda \
cryptodev-linux \
dpkg \
dpkg-native \
elfutils \
elfutils-native \
fftw \
gawk \
gcc-runtime \
gnupg \
hdparm \
icu \
kbd \
libassuan \
libatomic-ops \
libavahi-client \
libavahi-common \
libavahi-core \
libcap-ng \
libdaemon \
libgcc \
libgcc-initial \
libgcrypt \
libgpg-error \
libical \
libidn2 \
libksba \
libmnl \
libogg \
libtirpc \
libtool \
libtool-cross \
libubootenv \
libunistring \
libxcrypt \
linux-libc-headers \
lz4 \
lzo \
npth \
pinentry \
pulseaudio \
qemuwrapper-cross \
resize-helper \
rust \
rust-llvm \
rust-llvm-native \
rust-native \
systemd \
systemd-compat-units \
systemd-conf \
systemd-mount-partitions \
tar \
vala \
xxhash \
zstd \
"
```

The main one I want to remove is Rust, but I still see it building in the log.

I have also tried using `IMAGE_INSTALL:remove` (in fact, I have both at the same time at the moment in my `local.conf` file), but it doesn't seem to work either. I have also tried both options in my `bbappend` file with no success either.

What am I doing wrong here? Is removing Rust even possible?

Some other packages I'm trying to remove are also appearing in the build log, like `dpkg-native` or `cmake`.

Thank you.

Randomly removing things just does not work (TM).

Bitbake builds only what you tell it to anyways, so whatever you see in
your build is directly (because it goes into the resulting image) or
indirectly (because it is needed to build the resulting image) defined by
your target. So the things you can do is:
- looking at your image recipe, and remove things
- looking at your machine and distro, if they add things, and remove there.
Rust native is almost impossible to remove nowadays, because it is a build
dependency of python3-cryptography.

Greetz,
Josef

Hello,

Thank you for your response.

I guess we'll keep building Rust (slowly).

About the other packages I wanted to remove, does `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE` or `IMAGE_INSTALL:remove` not work in this case? Is my only option to dig through the recipes and remove them there directly?

Thank you.

You can add SKIP_RECIPE[rust-native]  in your local.conf and bitbake will
tell you all the other parts you need to avoid (e.g. librsvg, ...)

Hello,

Thank you, SKIP_RECIPE is what I was looking for. Unfortunately, it is a dependency for python3-cryptography, as was mentioned in another message, and the build fails instantly, so it doesn't look like we'll be removing it.

Thank you anyways.

Also in some of recipies your dependencies might be gated by
PACKAGECONFIG flags. You might be able to gate them by disabling some
of PACKAGECONFIG features.
