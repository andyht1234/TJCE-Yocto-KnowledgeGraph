To eliminate target option from the recipe I just need to make sure the
name of the recipe ends with -native, then removing inherit native works
fine.

Actually by removing `inherit native` and adding -native to the recipe name
doesn't make it build for native.

My solution was to use recipe name without `-native`, and simply use empty
packages (no-op) for target.  Only nativesdk- and -native variants have an
affect.  Then add `TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TASK:append = " nativesdk-flutter-sdk"`
to local.conf.
