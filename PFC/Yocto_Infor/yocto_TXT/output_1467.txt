Although bitbake.conf sets the default SDKMACHINE to the build
architecture, config.json resets that to i686.

As oe-selftest assumes that the SDKs it builds are usable on the host
machine, we should set SDKMACHINE=aarch64 in the oe-selftest-armhost
build.

A follow-up more invasive patch to clean up the SDKMACHINE assignments
is in progress, once it has been verified to not cause regressions.
