Hello,

I have an archive file in Git which I need to install to /usr/bin

Below is the part of my recipe:

SRC_URI = " \
https://<..>/uploads/4417be0/test_v${PV}.zip \
"

do_install () {
install -d ${D}${bindir}/
unzip -q ${WORKDIR}/test_v${PV}.zip ${D}${bindir}/test
}

But, how can I set the permission to extracted file? I want to set 0755 permission to "test"

Thank you,
Sourabh
