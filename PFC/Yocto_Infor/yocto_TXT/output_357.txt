Hi Friends,
There is no Bluetooth module in my setup, there are number of other recipes which have dependency on Bluez5 package , removing the Bluez package from build recipe , still generates "Bluez D-Bus thr_core_dump.gz" on every shutdown ,this may be generated by other recipes who have dependency on Bluez5.

There is no need of this log ,
how can I, stop the generation of "Bluez D-Bus thr_core_dump.gz"  from all sources in build image.
