Hi,

In my system I have two displays (virtual) with different resolution
first: 1080x1920 (portrait orientation)
second: 640x720

When psplash is run, it shows boot animation with resolution 640x720 on 
the first display too:

+-----------+-----+
|           |     |
|  psplash  |     |
|           |     |
|           |     |
+-----------+     |
|                 |
|                 |
|    Display 1    |
|                 |
|                 |
+-----------------+

+-----------+
|           |
| psplash   |
| Display 2 |
|           |
+-----------+

Can we achieve 1080x1920 resolution on Display 1? I worth case I don't 
need boot animation on display 2. Is DRM/KMS backend needed for that?

Kind regards,
Vasyl
