Hi Guys,

I am building core-image-sato image. i am facing issue rootfs creation. can anybody know give suggition how we can solve this issue.

ERROR: core-image-sato-1.0-r0 do_rootfs: Postinstall scriptlets of ['man-pages'] have failed. If the intention is to defer them to first boot,
then please place them into pkg_postinst_ontarget_${PN} ().
Deferring to first boot via 'exit 1' is no longer supported.

Thanks & Regards,
Sateesh
