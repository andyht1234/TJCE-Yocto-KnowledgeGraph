Hi everyone,

I'm trying to remove some application, some of them packages and other being busybox parts.

I'm trying to remove hexdump from my image and I configured every busybox defconfig to have CONFIG_HEXDUMP and its REVERSE CONFIG to =n.

But I'm finding hexdump in my image filesystem nevertheless.

Any help?

Thank you and Regards.

Check oe-pkgdata-util find-path in your build to find out which 
package/recipe to actually look at.

Hi Joseph,

thank you for replying.

Shall I use the oe-pkgdata-util find-path this way?

oe-pkgdata-util  find-path /usr/bin/hexdump

Because I'm encountering an error
ERROR: Unable to find any package producing path /usr/bin/hexdump

So I think I am doing something wrong

You may not be getting any result because /usr/bin/hexdump is an
alternatives symlink to
/usr/bin/hexdump.util-linux for example (util-linux-hexdump).

Jason

Hi Luca,

I think you either need the right key/string:

$ oe-pkgdata-util  find-path /bin/ls.coreutils

coreutils: /bin/ls.coreutils


or to use a wildcard and quotes:

$ oe-pkgdata-util  find-path "/bin/ls*"

coreutils: /bin/ls.coreutils

kmod: /bin/lsmod.kmod



For help:

$ oe-pkgdata-util

oe-pkgdata-util: error: the following arguments are required: <subcommand>
