We've added an update to the end of the above link with a deadline for
quotations and some other answers to commonly asked questions.

Cheers,

I read this and the linked articles and one piece in
https://www.linux.com/audience/maintainer-confidential-opportunities-and-challenges-of-the-ubiquitous-but-under-resourced-yocto-project/

I'm an old school engineer but I've never used the "patch to mailing list"
model so I find it quite difficult. It seemed like someone must have solved
this problem already so I've been looking around and found
https://gitgitgadget.github.io/ This is what the git mailing list use - you
create a PR in Github and it sends the patch to the mailing list. You then
respond to comments and update the PR. Finally someone merges your patch.
It seems like this could be implemented alongside the existing Patchwork
solution relatively easily and provide an alternate route to those of us
who prefer the modern tooling.

For a complete solution you could add the same functionality to Patchwork
(I assume you use https://github.com/getpatchwork/patchwork) to make it
bi-directional - patches from the mailing list are created as PRs in
Github, and PRs in Github have their patches emailed to the mailing list.
This then solves your Patchtest problem - the tests could instead be
implemented as CI builds in Github Actions (which is more maintainable) and
the results fed back to the mailing list. Alternatives to Github are of
course available.

Is the Patchtest source code available anywhere?

I think it probably could be done, I've wondered about this myself. The
challenge is that even getting patchwork working reliably and then
having patchtest on top of that back and operational has been a
challenge. The next step is to get our testing back and see if we can
keep that going this time. We still don't have great automation about
updating patchwork patch status for example either.

If patchtest is successful, there are things we may be able to build on
top of that. I suspect the challenge will be "permissions" both on the
mailing list side and on the github/whatever side and whether it can
show/link the "real" users or not.
