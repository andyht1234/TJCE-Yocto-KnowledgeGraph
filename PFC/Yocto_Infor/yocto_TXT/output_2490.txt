Hi,
I have a read-only rootfs created with IMAGE_FEATURES:append=read-only-rootfs and a few files located in a read/write partition which are defined in the volatile-bind recipe.
So far so good. But one file located in the rw partition is the network configuration (/usr/lib/systemd/network/20-wired.network). Unfortunately the network is loaded before the volatile-binds are mounted.
Does some one know, how to force volatile-bind to be mounted before the network is initialized?

I'm using systemd and dunfell.

Thanks,
Silvan
