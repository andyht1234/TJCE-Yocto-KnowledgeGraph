This didn't work (and wasn't merged) although I still think it is probably the
correct thing to do with that code.

I did some digging and the issue is that when we trigger builds, it triggers
them one at a time as part of a buildSet and the prioritisation function
therefore sees each build by itself and therefore gives it priority.

That raises the question of the order the triggers are run in. A list of builder
names is passed which is translated to a list of builderids. I think the order
is therefore determined by the database ID of the builders. I did wonder if
sorting the builders list would help but it does not.

There is code in schedulers/base.py which does:

        builderids = list()
        for bldr in (yield self.master.data.get(('builders', ))):
            if bldr['name'] in builderNames:
                builderids.append(bldr['builderid'])

which I think is where the sorting comes from.

I think we're going to have discuss this with upstream.

Cheers,

Richard
