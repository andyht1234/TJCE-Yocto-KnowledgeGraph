Hello,

It has been 2 years that i'm using the yocto project to build the image for an embedded system on IMX8M.
Now the system basic image is done outside and i receive the SDK.
All the additional packages that i was installing with my yocto project are missing because i receive the standard os image.
Is there a way to use the SDK that i receive to build the additional packages with bitbake?

Best regards

if its eSDK then you can, with standard application SDK not so much.

Hello Enrico,
usually nowadays every honest hardware manufacturer provides all the sources of the BSP and the development system to their customers.
Try asking your supplier for them.

Hello Marco,

In your opinion isn't enough to ask for eSDK? for instance if i want to add Node-RED, it would be difficult to build with devtool? because i've seen that it doesn't resolve dependencies automatically.
Thanks.

Hello Enrico,
an eSDK would be enough to do everything, however I would demand the entire development system if I were to start a project, but that is my opinion.
I don't know well Node-RED but using devtool add you should be able to create or manage a recipe for any Node application.
Happy hacking!
