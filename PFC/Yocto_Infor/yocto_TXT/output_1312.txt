I have this working now…

Thanks Matt for spotting those honister config issues, that led led me to the heart of the problem…

I am trying to make use of system to run a test script at boot…
I can exercise my test_script/test_script.service manually using systemctl commands and it appears to work as expects.

I created a recipe based on this, it builds clean (no errors/warnings), but it doesn’t appear to set things up correctly.
I have only recently begun working with honister, and new to systemd…

Could someone have look at my recipe & service file and see if they can spot anything ?

My recipe:

#
# This file is the my_test_script recipe.
#

SUMMARY = "Simple my_test_script application"
SECTION = "apps"
LICENSE = "MIT"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302<file://$%7bCOMMON_LICENSE_DIR%7d/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302>"

inherit systemd

SRC_URI = "file://test_script.sh \
           file://test_script.service"

S = "${WORKDIR}"

SYSTEMD_PACKAGES = "${PN}"
SYSTEMD_SERVICE_${PN} = "test_script.service"
SYSTEMD_AUTO_ENABLE:${PN} = "enable"

do_install() {
             install -d ${D}${bindir}
             install -m 0755 ${S}/test_script.sh ${D}${bindir}

             install -d ${D}${systemd_system_unitdir}
             install -m 0644 ${S}/test_script.service ${D}${systemd_system_unitdir}
}

FILES_${PN} = "${bindir}"
FILES_${PN} += "${systemd_system_unitdir}"

REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES="systemd"
---
My test script service file:

[Unit]
Description=Configure test

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/test_script.sh start
StandardOutput=journal+console

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
---
My test script:

#!/bin/bash
# description: Description comes here....

echo "*******************************"
echo "START: Hello PetaLinux World :)"
date +"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S $HOSTNAME"
echo "*******************************"

Thanks,
Steve
