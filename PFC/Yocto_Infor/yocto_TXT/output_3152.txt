Hi everyone,

I was asked to add some basic tests to an internal recipe in order to improve our CI system.

The purpose would be to produce an error if some check doesn't pass like
- a file is not present
- the generated file is of size 0
- the generated file is bigger than x bytes

I'm thinking to add the functionality to a class, in order to be able to use these tests in more than one recipe. Something like that: https://gist.github.com/samdolt/cf1c557f73f4f2098a19ba7ad6bc092f

Does something like that already exists? And if not, would it be useful to have this contributed upstream? Maybe as an addition to insane.bbclass?

Cheers,
Samuel

Hi Samuel

Please look at insane.bbclass and perhaps a new check can be added there ?
