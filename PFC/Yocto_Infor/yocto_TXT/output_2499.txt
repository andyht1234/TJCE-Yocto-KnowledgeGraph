I'm on the "dunfell" branch and trying to build core-image-minimal-initramfs for a j7-evm target.  When I do that I get the following error:

If I build for the genericx86-64 target it builds successfully.  I think the problem is with it needing "grub" for the j7-evm target because I don't believe grub is needed nor built for that target.  The bootloader in that case is u-boot.  Is there something I need to do to tell it the bootloader is u-boot rather than grub maybe?  Anyone have any ideas and/or guidance?  Thanks in advance.

Mike
