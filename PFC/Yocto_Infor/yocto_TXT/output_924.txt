Hi, I am trying to build an image using kas built tool for ti TDA4VM. For this I have created the attached j721e.yml file. When I put machine as j721e-evm it is showing the below error " Overrides could not be expanded into a stable state after 5 iterations, overrides must be being referenced by other overridden variables in some recursive fashion. Please provide your configuration to bitbake-devel so we can laugh ". In meta-ti for the machine j721e-evm it includesÂ cons/machine/include/k3.inc and then we can see it specifies kernel as linux-ti-staging, so it should be meta-ti-bsp/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-ti-staging/linux-ti-staging_5.10.bb as building kernel, but some how k3.inc is throwing that overrides error. Can someone provide me with some insights on this. Will be really helpful.
