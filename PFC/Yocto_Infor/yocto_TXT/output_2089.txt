Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.5 M3 has been released.
*	YP 3.1.15 is now in QA
*	There are patches proposed to move python3-cryptography to OE-Core
from meta-oe/meta-python. It is late in the cycle but the current location
is causing issues for several layers and it appears to be the right thing to
do before kirkstone is released.
*	There is a proposal to switch from pip to installer to handle
installation of python modules. With some development, the path becomes
clear in hindsight and this is another change where it seems to make sense
to do it now.
*	Other than the above, we should be seeing the recent python changes
settling down.
*	There were some tweaks to the tasks display in knotty merged.
*	We took an upgrade to mesa 22 which drops dri1 support on the basis
it stands the release in a better long term position.
*	We have continued to take other minimal impact upgrades and this is
having a positive impact on CVE numbers.
*	Toaster has seen a number of fixes recently and should be in a
stronger position for release with a move to an LTS django version, thanks
Tim and David.
*	Help in completing the migration documentation would be much
appreciated.
*	If people see intermittent issues in their own builds, particularly
if they're the same as intermittent issues seen on the autobuilder, please
do comment in the bugs mentioning when they happen as the frequency
information does help us prioritize fixing the most common issues.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at record high levels and help is
very much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:

*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
