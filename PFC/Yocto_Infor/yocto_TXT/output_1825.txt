have two yocoto images and i need to make a dual boot for them. I make two partitions in dev/mmcblk1 called mmcblk1p1 & mmcblk1p2. I install first image in mmcblk1p1 & the second image in mmcblk1p2 with dd commannd.

I add a title and menu with grub.cfg but no success to boot to the second image.

Also try to boot from the grub shell with the following commands but no success

grub> ls
grub> (hd0) (hd0,gpt2) (hd0,gpt1)
grub> set root=(hd0,gpt2)
grub> linux (hd0,gpt2)/vmlinuz 
grub> initrd (hd0,gpt2)/initrd
grub> boot

Also try with the parted command to set on the boot flag to specific image but no success.
