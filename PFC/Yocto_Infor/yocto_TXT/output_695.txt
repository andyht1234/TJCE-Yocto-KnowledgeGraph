Hi all!

We are happy to have an in-person Dev Day again, colocated with the EOSS in
Prague. It will take place on Monday June 26th, and it... (wait for it)...
needs YOU!

Specifically, it needs your ideas, your experience, your stories. Shared
them! The CFP is open now, use those cold and rainy days in spring to
submit at https://summit.yoctoproject.org/devday-at-eoss-2023/cfp

Or, even register along with EOSS:
https://events.linuxfoundation.org/embedded-open-source-summit/features/co-located-events/#yocto-project-dev-day

See you there!

Josef,
on behalf of the Dev Day committee
