Hello,

Topposting since the problem is in the screenshot.

The issue is the naming of the shared object. Linux convention is that a 
shared object contains the version number e.g. log_wrapper.so.1 and 
log_wrapper.so is a link to that file.

In you make file either change the install target or use 
-soname=log_wrapper.so.1 when invoking gcc to create the shared object.

Looks like the libraries are unversioned.  This is pretty bad practise
but https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/common-tasks.html#working-with-pre-built-libraries
should help.

The best solution is to get OMADM to version the libraries, instead of
working around their unversioned libraries in the recipe.
