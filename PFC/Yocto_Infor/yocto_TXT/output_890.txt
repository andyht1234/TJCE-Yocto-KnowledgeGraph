I am building Yocto on a WSL2 instance on a Win 11 development environment.

So, things used to build. Now, I am receiving this error: ERROR: Task (/home/$USER/poky/meta/recipes-devtools/gcc/gcc-crosssdk_12.2.bb:do_compile) failed with exit code '1'

Could this be due to the lack of prerequisite dependencies for building?

It’s impossible to say without seeing what the actual error is.  Share more of your logs and we might be able to help.
