Hi,

I'm new to yocto, I wonder the recommended way to setup an environment for
yocto using vagrant or docker to isolate from the host, since I've
encounter many different error about python version or something like that.
Some layers providede by vendor uses a tool called repo
<https://source.android.com/setup/develop#repo> for version control, I
always cannot install on my machine, following the steps form that page
doesn't help either.

Thanks,
CD

I recommend taking a look at the kas project.[1] It allows you to manage Yocto layers in your project in a very easy
and pleasant way. You can also take a look at the Yocto Summit presentation [2] which talks about various ways of
managing Yocto layers. Good luck with learning the Yocto Project.
