bbappends are appending content to already existing recipes. There are 
two possible issues, for chromium_%.bbappend, no chromium recipe is 
found in the included layers, make sure the layer with chromium recipe 
is added with bitbake-layers add-layer.

For bbappends for version specific recipes, e.g. 
u-boot-fw-utils_2017.01.bbappend either u-boot-fw-utils recipe does not 
exist anymore, the layer containing it is not included in your build or 
the recipe does exist and the layer is included but the recipe is of a 
different version (e.g. 2019.07 or something like that).

I know u-boot-fw-utils has been renamed to libubootenv in some versions 
(don't remember if it was already the case in dunfell though).

But it is likely just a mismatch of the recipe version upon which the 
bbappend would be applied.

The fix is to find the new name of the recipe, update the bbappend to 
apply to the correct recipe version by changing its filename and/or add 
the necessary layers.

Cheers,
Quentin
