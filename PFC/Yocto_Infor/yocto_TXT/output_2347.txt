Dear folks,

I found the lts period of Yocto dunfell has been extended from 2022.04 to
2024.04[1].
AFAIK, a Yocto LTS version has 2 years period. I tried to find any notice
regarding this but I just found Richard's e-mail[2] in last year.
Can I find any thread or notice regarding this extension?

I received the answer to this question in IRC on 10/29/2021.

16:06 <https://libera.irclog.whitequark.org/yocto/2021-10-29#31083490> <
jatedev> I saw a wiki edit that said dunfell's LTS period is now through
April 2024, but I've seen no announcements. Any truth to this rumor?
16:20 <https://libera.irclog.whitequark.org/yocto/2021-10-29#31083555> <
smurray> jatedev: it was announced on one of the technical calls a few
weeks back, so yes AFAIK
16:25 <https://libera.irclog.whitequark.org/yocto/2021-10-29#31083577> <RP>
jatedev: definitely true. I wish we could sort out the project advocacy
side of things :(

Let this email serve as a little advocacy.

Hello together,

I would like to add a question to the topic:

Why was the LTS period for dunfell extended?
Can we expect the same for kirstone?

Many greetings,
Matthias

Actually, I think this was some kind of missed PR opportunity. Regular
distros, such as RHEL, Debian and everyone else, are constantly trotting
out their support windows as the reason to hand them the job of making
products, so we could counter that better perhaps.

The project members agreed to fun an extension to the lifetime of dunfell from 2
years to 4 years. There should have been some announcements about this but we
lack people on the advocacy side of the project with time to make that happen.
That saddens me a lot and I think it is a missed opportunity but there isn't
much I can do about it beyond what I've already tried.

Extending Dunfell is an experiment so we would base a decision on how well the
dunfell extension is working out. Extending an LTS like this requires a
financial commitment from the project. At this point in time the project cannot
commit to extending kirkstone as we can't guarantee the finances. 

Cheers,

Richard

If you want persistent PRs between builds after deleting the build
tree, simply archive the PR database.

We're not going back to manually updating the PR on changes.
