Key Status/Updates:

*	Next week is feature freeze for 3.5, our next LTS release
*	YP 3.1.14 passed QA and is due to be released
*	YP 3.2.4 rc2 is in QA (rc1 had sstate networking issues)
*	We're extremely worried about the inclusive language changes since
these are not anywhere near ready and the freeze deadline is in days. This
is an important topic but sadly we're simply starved of people with the
right time and skills to spend on it. There is an email on the
openembedded-architecture list about this.
*	The autobuilder infrastructure is planned to be offline 26-28th
February for a data center move. Public services like the website, wiki and
git servers will remain live but the git backend (push.yoctoproject.org)
will be offline, as will the downloads and sstate services and the
autobuilder/NAS.
*	We've upgraded to the new glibc version and have patches in testing
for the new binutils release assuming some minor issues there are resolved.
*	There are changes proposed to the bitbake git fetcher handling of
tags. We resolve these against the upstream repositories and the caching of
the values was showing issues such as network accesses in the unpack task.
We advice against using tags due to the potential for them to change, any
layers using them may seen error messages depending on whether their usage
is problematic.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at record high levels and help is
very much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

In particular, we're struggling to understand the intermittent network issue
with external hosts we're seeing very occasionally.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help us resolve CVE issues:
