We have custom patches for building dhcrelay and dhclient. How do we use the dhcp source files and build separately for dhcrelay and dhclient? Should we create a new recipe for dhcrelay and dhclient? How do we then consume the files from poky/recipes-connectivity/dhcp?

what are benefits of having separate recipes for them? I would say
creating separate output packages should be effective enough for
granularity.

Thanks Khem, can you please help explain or give an example of a package that is doing this? If we had separate output packages, are you suggesting we build 3 times- each time after applying a patch related to dhcrelay and dhclient?

We are somewhat doing this today where binaries dhcrelay and dhclient need to be built with different build options and with different patch files.

git apply $WORKSPACE/git-build/dhcrelay.patch

devtool modify dhcp

devtool build dhcp

cp $WORKSPACE/work/poky/build/workspace/sources/ dhcp /relay/dhcrelay $OUR_WORKPSACE/ dhcp /dhcrelay

devtool reset dhcp

git apply $WORKSPACE/git-build/dhclient.patch

devtool modify dhcp

devtool build dhcp

cp $WORKSPACE/work/poky/build/workspace/sources/ dhcp /relay/dhclient $OUR_WORKPSACE/ dhcp /dhclient
