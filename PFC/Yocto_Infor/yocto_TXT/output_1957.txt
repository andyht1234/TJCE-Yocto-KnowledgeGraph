I was building esdk using Honister release and added a single package (using IMAGE_INSTALL), providing a library. As per documentation, target Sysroot must contain all the libraries and header files needed to build applications for target. I do not need to explicitly add my library providing package to TOOLCHAIN_TARGET_TASK, since it will get all packages getting installed in the final image. However, I do not see my library in target Sysroot. I tried to add poky provided package `libyaml`, to see if my library providing recipe is doing something wrong, but result was the same and no libyaml could be found in target Sysroot, but it was only added to the host sysroot.

I checked the same on dunfell branch and could not find libyaml in target Sysroot, however it was in the host Sysroot for esdk.

I also checked the same for sdk on Dunfell, but could see libyaml in target Sysroot.

So, It seems there is something broken for esdk.
