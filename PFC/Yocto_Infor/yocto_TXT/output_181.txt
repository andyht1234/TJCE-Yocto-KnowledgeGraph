Hi everybody

I am a newcomer currently trying to figure out, how I can build a
library and a binary from one source repository in one recipe. The
reason for the "one recipe" is that both, the library and the binary
come from the same source repository (OpenBLT). The problem is, that
the project is split up into different parts, whereas the binary used
on the target depends on the library, which is a separate CMake
project.
So this means, I need to run two different builds, two configures, two
builds and two deployments on top of one source repository.
Neither using the search function on the project documentation
(https://docs.yoctoproject.org/search.html) nor google pointed me to a
hint on how to start doing so.
I am still trying to figure things out, merely by trial and error,
which is quite cumbersome and extremely time consuming. My current
approach is something like

PACKAGES += "${PN}-lib ${PN}-bin"

But I am still confused on how to use them.

So to me the questions arrive how can I achieve

* That I first configure and build the library
* Then configure and build the binary using the previously built
library
* Then install the library and the binary in the image and provide the
library also in the sdk

I could create two recipes - but that would mean, the same sources are
downloaded twice, am I right?

Best Regards
David

Two recipes seems like the best option, if the library and the
executable build processes are completely decoupled. You needn't worry
about downloading twice: if SRC_URI entry is the same, fetch tasks for
the two recipes will mutually exclude each other, and then reuse the
result from the other task that ran first.

Ah I see, if I use the same source in two different recipes, it won't
get downloaded twice. That's definitely the better approach then. That
way I can make the binary depending on the library.

Thanks!
