Greetings,

Do we still have nightly builds? I cannot find them anywhere, but the
documentation still refer to a broken location
(https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/nightly/).

I'll be happy to remove the corresponding chapter
(https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/start.html#accessing-nightly-builds)
if indeed we no longer produce such builds.

Cheers
Michael.

We do run them but they're "a-quick" six nights a week with an "a-full" on a
weekend. The results of all non-release builds go here:

https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/

The "nightly" builds don't produce shared artefacts any more, just test result
files and reports.

Cheers,

Richard

Right. So the documentation can stop referring to them as a way to get
the latest code.
Thanks
Michael.

I think it should be replaced with something about "latest test results"?

Cheers,

Richard

Maybe, but then in the test manual, because the section referring to
nightly builds about getting Yocto Project code
(https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/start.html#locating-yocto-project-source-files).

Thanks

Michael.

Right, in that context I agree it can be removed and probably wasn't that useful
anyway.

Richard
