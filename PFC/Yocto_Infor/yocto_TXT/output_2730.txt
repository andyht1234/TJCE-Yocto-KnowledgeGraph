Hi Guys,

I am facing bellow error while building KDE support using meta-qt5-extra layer.can any body know please suggest me how can i fix this problem.

I have added already qttools -> this will provide Qt5LinguistTools but getting below error.

Error displayed:
 CMake Error at /usr/share/ECM/modules/ECMPoQmTools.cmake:144 (find_package): Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5LinguistTools"  with any of the following names:

    Qt5LinguistToolsConfig.cmake
    qt5linguisttools-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "Qt5LinguistTools" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or  set "Qt5LinguistTools_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
files.  If "Qt5LinguistTools" provides a separate development package or  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
/usr/share/ECM/modules/ECMPoQmTools.cmake:234 (ecm_process_po_files_as_qm)  CMakeLists.txt:317 (ecm_install_po_files_as_qm)
