Hi,

I was trying to build a linux image for the microchip SAMA7 board with the
dm-verity feature of the meta-security layer. But using this layer for
dm-verity causes a circular dependency error during build.

my *local.conf *changes:






*INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE = "1"INITRAMFS_IMAGE =
"dm-verity-image-initramfs"DM_VERITY_IMAGE =
"custom-image-sama7"DM_VERITY_IMAGE_TYPE = "squashfs"IMAGE_CLASSES +=
"dm-verity-img"*

I have to comment out the line:
*do_rootfs[depends] +=
"${DM_VERITY_IMAGE}:do_image_${DM_VERITY_IMAGE_TYPE}"*
in the dm-verity-image-initramfs.bb file to avoid this circular dependency.
But then the .itb file in the new wic image is not updated with the new
rootfs ROOT_HASH. So the dm-verity check during boot fails and the image
won't boot.

I'm using the dunfell branch. Is there any way to fix this issue and get a
working wic image?
