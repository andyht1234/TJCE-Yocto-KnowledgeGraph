I'm building Linux image using yocto 4.2. I've already set up the root password on the local.conf file with hash generated my MD5 using openssl openssl passwd -1 root

INHERIT += "extrausers"

EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "usermod -p '\$1$bI3FOrM/$aAr4Ar09j0BXowgMygJWt0' root;"

I'm getting the following error when trying to login as root.

root logging error crypt method not supported by libcrypt? (MD5)

Then I tried SHA256Â  and SHA512 hash using openssl passwd -6 root and getting the same error !!

qemuarm64 login: root

Password:

crypt method not supported by libcrypt? (SHA512)
