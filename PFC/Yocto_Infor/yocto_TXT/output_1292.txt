I want to increase the performance streaming from a rpi4 via an rtsp streamer.

I am using ffmpeg to do the encoding however it is using CPU encoding.

What is the right options for using the hardware in 264 encoding?
I assume it is  -c:v h264_omx

That is not compiled it.

I added to ffmpeg_%.bbappend

I get the error.

ERROR: OMX_Core.h not found

Am I braking up the wrong tree here?

Thanks

I see that you are using the following (EXO) player:
https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer

I see that you are trying to use the HW codec for H264.

In Android, I use also the SW codec with the option:
--encoder OMX.google.h264.encoder

This email is just to make the context much cleaner, and
understandable... To YOCTO primes.

And, yes, It is interesting to me as well. How to include rpi4 HW
coders into the context? ;-)

NOT only for rpi4 silicon... ;-))

Thank you all,
Zee
