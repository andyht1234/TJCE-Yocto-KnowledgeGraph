This second series continues in the same general theme of making it
easier to use dm-verity within the Yocto/OE framework by adding a worked
example that can boot on x86-64 in QEMU and on physical hardware.

A couple small clarifications to exisitng files are also added.

Based on my reading, I believe there are still two things that would be
nice to support if time permits.  They are somewhat intertwined. 

Firstly, the dm-verity basically has two places to store the hash data -
at the end of the filesystem data in an "oversized" partition, or in a
completely separate partition/device.  Our current support is hardwired
to the append single partition support.

Secondly, we currently call veritysetup from within the initramfs with
all the parameters (hash size, location etc.) - which was sensible for
a sysV init based system.  However my reading seems to indicate that
recent systemd supports direct enablement of dm-verity device(s) from
either boot arguments or autodetection via GPT UUIDs assigned to
dm-verity (and dm-verity-hash).  Meaning (in theory) we should not
need to be manually calling veritysetup in a systemd initramfs at all.

So we'll see how that goes.  Might lead to another wks.in example?

Some platform creators tend to list a whole bunch of layers by
default in conf/bblayers.conf.  Without getting into the debate of
whether that is a good idea, it can tend to have the effect of
people seeing the meta-security DISTRO_FEATURES warning time and
time again and becoming essentially numb to it.

After having fallen into this trap myself, I figured it was worth
the extra mention in the dm-verity doc so there is a better chance
of users realizing "hey - this applies to me!".

Adding to your local.conf right out of the gate:

  EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "read-only-rootfs"

while you are trying to sort out other things can be just another
complication to an already steep learning curve.

For example, I found simply enabling this with systemd caused:

  systemd[1]: Failed to fork off sandboxing environment for executing generators: Protocol error
  [!!!!!!] Failed to start up manager.
  systemd[1]: Freezing execution.

While I'd like to get to the root cause of that, it doesn't change that
things boot fine w/o adding to EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES, even though the
rootfs is still read-only courtesy of dm-verity.

Reword things so as to make it clear it isn't strictly a hard requirement
and hence can be delayed as people work through their implementation.

We have systemd-bootdisk-dmverity.wks.in as an example template but
no mention of it in docs or config files.  Similar to the beaglebone
black insructions added earlier, we do the same for (qemu)x86-64.

This hopefully walks through getting things configured for building
a systemd based dm-verity image and booting it on qemux86-64 --filling
in a lot of blanks and assumptions so that someone relatively new to
the feature can get off the ground more quickly by using qemu as a
stepping stone towards their final physical implementation.

Finally, the full image is deployed and booted on real hardware.

+dm-verity and x86-64 and systemd
+--------------------------------
+In this example, we'll target combining qemux86-64 with dm-verity and
+also systemd - systemd has dm-verity bindings and is more likely to be
+used on x86.
+
+While dm-verity in a qemu environment doesn't make practial sense as a
+deployment - it can be a useful stepping stone for testing and getting to
+a final physical deployment.
+
+Set/uncomment the MACHINE line for "qemux86-64" if you haven't yet.  It
+should be the default if unspecified, but check to be sure.  As of this
+writing (kernel v6.1) the resulting qemux86-64 build can also be booted
+successfully on physical hardware, but if you don't intend to use qemu,
+you might instead want to choose "genericx86-64"
+
+This will make use of wic/systemd-bootdisk-dmverity.wks.in -- note that it
+contains a dependency on the meta-intel layer for microcode, so you'll need
+to fetch and add that layer in addition to the meta-security related layers.
+
+In addition to the basic dm-verity settings, choose systemd in local.conf:
+
+DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " security systemd"
+VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
+EFI_PROVIDER = "systemd-boot"
+PACKAGECONFIG:append:pn-systemd = " cryptsetup"
+
+Note the last line - you won't typically see that in on-line instructions
+for enabling systemd.  It is important for dm-verity, since it triggers
+the build and installation of components like this onto the rootfs:
+
+   /lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-veritysetup-generator
+   /lib/systemd/systemd-veritysetup
+
+Now build the components for the wic image:
+
+   bitbake intel-microcode
+   bitbake core-image-minimal
+

The error you are seeing above is due to a bug in systemd. It is fixed 
in version 253.4 (commit 5ed087fa46dc04ee92da12635777b2b622183a5d).
