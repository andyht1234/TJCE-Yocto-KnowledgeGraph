Hello List

i want to apply rt-patch in raspberry-pi by following ( using-traditional-kernel-development-to-patch-the-kernel ( https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.1.20/kernel-dev/kernel-dev-common.html#using-traditional-kernel-development-to-patch-the-kernel ) ) So in order to achieve that i created my own meta-layer and put that patch in bblayers. In oreder to apply patching i did following steps .

* I downloaded patch file from ( https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.4/older/patch-5.4.70-rt40.patch.gz ) unzip and rename with ( patch-5.4.70-rt40.patch) ( https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.4/older/patch-5.4.70-rt40.patch.gz )
* I put that patch file in yocto/meta-mylayer/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto.
* And given patch file's path in yocto/meta-mylayer/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_4.12.bbappend by following lines

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"
SRC_URI_append  = "file://patch-5.4.70-rt40.patch"
( As described in above document) ( https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.1.20/kernel-dev/kernel-dev-common.html#using-traditional-kernel-development-to-patch-the-kernel ) )

when i am trying to bake my recipe : bitbake core-image-base then following error is showing

Loading cache: 100% |############################################| Time: 0:00:01
Loaded 3004 entries from dependency cache.
ERROR: No recipes available for:
/home/nikita/yocto/meta-mylayer/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_4.12.bbappend

Summary: There was 1 ERROR message shown, returning a non-zero exit code.

Can anyone please suggest me how can i apply rt-patch in my raspberry-image with above method by solving corrensponding error.

Thanks in advance
Nikita Gupta

There is a version mismatch. If you want to patch the 5.4 kernel, why
is the bbappend for 4.12?

Hello Alex

Because i had cloned linux-yocto for 4.12 as stated in (https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.1.20/kernel-dev/kernel-dev-common.html#using-traditional-kernel-development-to-patch-the-kernel) but after that i renamed it from 4.12.bbappend to 5.4 now error got resolved but my kernel has not patched it has not become rt-patched.

What else i can do for making rt-patched kernel for reaspberry image?

It is not possible to say what went wrong if I cannot see the changes
you did, what commands you type, and what is the outcome (vs. what you
expect). So you need to publish your code somewhere, and describe all
of those things.

Hello Alex,
Sorry for late reply. Actually i madert- image by setting the preferred virtual/kernel type.
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-raspberrypi-rt"

and bake the recipe for following target.
bitbake core-image-base

I got my image successfully and it is booting up, but it is not taking user input from my keyboard. Why is it happening?

Thanks in Advance

In this case I have no idea unfortunately. Does a regular kernel work?
