  at some point, will there be a poky (meta-yocto-bsp) RISC-V
reference board? i'm thinking the Nezha Allwinner D1 (which is
already supported in meta-riscv) would be a safe choice. or maybe the
more powerful VisionFive 2?

  thoughts?

Hi Robert,

It has been discussed at numerous occasions. The main blocker is: we need a
commitment for the maintenance. So if a high-ranking member decides to push
forwards with this and allocate resources, or a new member from the RISC-V
ecosystem steps up to make it happen, then the project is all ears.

Greetz,
Josef

Hi all,
I was trying to get /var/lib and some files set up in my yocto build.
I read that setting VOLATILE_LOG_DIR ?= "no" would mean the directory I created during the bitbake would get copied over
However when I tried it I got...
| apt-pkg/tagfile-keys.cc:1:10: fatal error: /include/apt-pkg/tagfile-keys.h: No such file or directory
|     1 | #include "/include/apt-pkg/tagfile-keys.h"
|       |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| compilation terminated.
| ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.
| WARNING: exit code 1 from a shell command.
| ERROR: Execution of '/home/dave/Documents/Kymati/yocto/build/tmp/work/cortexa53-crypto-phytec-linux/apt/2.2.2-r0/temp/run.do_install.277311' failed with exit code 1
ERROR: Task (/home/dave/Documents/Kymati/yocto/sources/poky/../poky/meta/recipes-devtools/apt/apt_2.2.2.bb:do_install) failed with exit code '1'

I didnt change anything else. I wonder if someone could confirm why this happens, and the best route to achieve the actual aim (the var lib directory created)

BR
and thanks for the help
Dave

   Ask and ye shall receive. I just got the following private note
from jiaqi.dong@starfivetech.com, who obviously saw my earlier post
(and agreed to let me reproduce his response to me to the list):

  Sound promising?

Can you clarify please what LTS means here?

  I don't know, this is just the email I got from someone at StarFive
who considered me the right contact person because I asked the
question in the first place.

The project has been talking to the RISC-V Foundation for a while about
this. The tricky part is that adding official support for a new
architecture isn't a cheap or easy undertaking for the project.

The autobuilder for example has hardware to pay for as well as
bandwidth and power costs. If we add a new architecture, the test
matrix is larger and the costs rise. There is also the increased human
load of more tests, more failures and more work to do.

Intel, AMD and ARM are platinum members and this partly allows for the
architecture support. MIPS and PowerPC are on the list for legacy
reasons and their testing scope is being scaled back.

We've discussed and agreed that adding a new architecture with all the
work it entails is at least around a platinum membership level of
impact for us. Therefore, to have official support of a new
architecture, we've asked that there be support either from existing
membership or new members of around that level.

When you look at the details of what you get, that price tag is
actually quite reasonable for the level of automated testing performed.

We've been clear about our position on this for a while. There are
actually discussions in progress about it with both the foundation and
RISE and I have some reasons to be optimistic but some of this has been
going back and forth for a number of years. FWIW, personally I would
love to see the support officially there and it in our test matrix.

Cheers,

Richard
