Hi,

I want to inlude "lsusb" to investigate the connected usb devices to my 
system.
I found that adding

IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " usbutils"

to my configuration should solve the issue. I've added this to my 
local.conf and invoked a rebuild of my packages but still, after the 
rebuild, my package.manifest file still does not list lsusb.

How can I get lsusb included in my image?

Try IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " usbutils-python"

I've added that, issued a cleanall and rebuilt but it unfortunately did 
not give me the expected result either:

$ grep usb path/to/package.manifest
   libusb-1.0-0
   usbutils
   usbutils-python

lsusb is part of usbutils, so it is not explicitly listed, but should 
be included in your image

Oh, I think the cleanall didn't wipe the cache sufficiently, after I 
deleted contents in sstate-cache/ I get the following:
$ tar -tvf path/to/myimage-20221224185313.rootfs.tar.gz  | grep lsusb
lrwxrwxrwx 0/0               0 2018-03-09 04:34 ./usr/bin/lsusb -> 
/usr/bin/lsusb.usbutils
-rwxr-xr-x 0/0           14266 2018-03-09 04:34 ./usr/bin/lsusb.py
-rwxr-xr-x 0/0          247976 2018-03-09 04:34 ./usr/bin/lsusb.usbutils
-rw-r--r-- 0/0              43 2018-03-09 04:34 
./usr/lib/opkg/alternatives/lsusb

I would expect "$ lsusb" to work now when I copy this to my board 
(cannot est right now)

the package.manifest however still only lists:

libusb-1.0-0
usbutils
usbutils-python

The package.manifest only contains packages so it's normal that lsusb 
does not appear there since there's no package *named* lsusb.

E.g. there's no lsusb package in Debian, but you can install it on your 
system via the usbutils package.

However, one can check which package provides the libusb binary by running
oe-pkgdata-util find-path '*/libusb'
it should return usbutils I believe.

Cheers,
Quentin
