Hello!


I'd like debug an application that is running on my target board.
I installed gdbserver on the target, and I'd like to connect to it
from a gdb instance running locally.

Because of a broken 3rd party meta-layer, I'm currently unable to
build the SDK.  In short, the `populate_sdk` task fails, as well as
`meta-toolchain`.

This page[1] of the documentation suggests to run
`bitbake gdb-cross-<architecture>` (where <architecture>=aarch65, in
my case).  The task completes successfully.

I can find my gtb binary:

	$ find $tmp -name aarch64-foobar-gdb

It ends up being in a sysroot:

	$tmp/sysroots-components/x86_64/gdb-cross-aarch64/usr/bin/aarch64-foobar/aarch64-foobar-gdb

Unfortunately, invoking such binary fails because of runtime
dependencies (python) being missing.  It will dump a stack trace
and say:

	AttributeError: module 'sys' has no attribute 'lib'

This is most likely due to some PATH-like environment variable not
being set.  I've asked for advice on #yocto, where I was suggested to
try with `bitbake -c devshell`.

The trick seems to work in that I can find various aarch64-foobar-*
executables, but I can't find aarch64-foobar-gdb.  There are also
a few incompatible binaries, e.g. aarch64-none-elf-gdb, arm-none-...gdb.
None of them seem to be useful agains my target.

How can I include aarch64-foobar-gdb in the devshell's PATH?



Thanks in advance,
- dacav

Follow up on this thread: I've been kindly helped by kroon on #yocto.
The trick consists in adding a build-time dependency to gdb-cross-aarch64
in my recipe:

	DEPEND = "gdb-cross-aarch64"

At this point I can just use `bitbake -c devshell $myrecipe` and the
debugger is available.

Bonus: the devshell turns out to be very useful as a replacement
for the SDK: the environment allows me to do the cross-compilation
with just a `make`, while earlier I needed to run `bitbake $myrecipe`
and wait several seconds.

perhaps gdb-cross-${TARGET_ARCH} would be more generic.
