Patching piece below looks quite a bit.
lets just fix v5.14.14 and dont worry about 3.4

once dot release is out then thats whats maintained not the original
release since they are incremental.
the anon python to apply a patch. Can you explain why we want to patch

I am not yet convinced why should we have such version specific patch

If you could explain what's *really* bothering you, I could try to find a proper explanation or agree with you but it's a bit too vague to me right now. Anyway, I'll do some guesses in the next paragraphs.

Because Ethernet does not work for all RK3399-based boards in the latest and only release of Honister?

meta-rockchip is the BSP layer for Rockchip based devices, if not there, where should I put this patch?

Or are we just going to say "Ethernet does not work, we know" to people asking instead of having this patch in? Obviously you could tell them to upgrade their oe-core/poky git repo to rolling honister or 3.4.1 once it's out but having this patch in avoid those questions.

I understand we're talking about policy here. I am not fond of this patch either but Ethernet is quite critical on boards which don't have WiFi for example. I don't have anything better to suggest to fix this in the *latest* release.

meta-rockchip does not have honister branch for now. So it expects
master to keep working with honister for now. kernel upgrades are
already committed into honister branch on meta-yocto-bsps so fix it
already available in latest honister
branch and will be in imminent point release soon as well.

I would say yes, document it as that of a known issue and possible fix
if someone is using exact point release. They might have snapshotted
meta-rockpi too and in that case it will be easy for them to carry a
local patch if needed.
vesion specific patching would also be setting a not so desired
patching practice, so I am trying to avoid it if we can.

Update to latest honister branch or wait for 3.4.1, would be my suggestion.

Do we still need this patch ? I think now that dot release is out it’s less
of a problem. Version specific patching will set a different preset for the
layer to carry unexcercised patches

We need this patch for honister 3.4 but what I meant is that even though it's not needed for honister >= 3.4.1, I'm still interested in what the policy should be. Especially what we should have done between 3.4 and 3.4.1, before the latter was released.

I understand the precedent it creates but also, it's a bit sad for a "BSP" layer to have some support broken between Yocto releases.

Cheers,
Quentin

I agree with you that broken is not good as it was for sometime, but
now with the latest  supported release in 3.4 series ( which is 3.4.1)
things should be good.

I apologize for not reviewing this patch in a timely manner; I'm sorry for the
frustration it caused.

Would this have been solved by (me) creating a honister  branch? I usually
don't create a release branch until openembedded-core moves, but this looks
like it was a case where master and the latest branch diverged?

If so, would that still be useful?

Best regards,
	Trevor
