I am running into a bizarre problem with kernel configuration.

I have an existing build environment that builds for an i.MX6ul machine. 
That works fine and the linux-fslc kernel 5.18 builds without any 
problems. Now within the that build environment I changed the machine to 
imx6ullevk and then the kernel configuration fails with this error message:

| DEBUG: Executing shell function do_kernel_configme

I tried to debug do_kernel_configme. The issue seems in the scc script 
more specifically, I think, in the kconf command that is called by scc 
when parsing the temporary configuration queue file in /tmp: tmp.owmBptYrba

Apparently a call to dirname is missing the argument. However, I do not 
understand why.

I wiped out build/tmp directory entirely, ran a cleanall on 
virtual/kernel but to no avail. The problem remains the same.

Has anybody seen this issue before?

Hi Rudolf,

I have reported this issue and together with a path [1] to fix it.
Anyway Bruce has fixed the issue in another way in [2] and this works for
me as well.

Yes indeed. This has also passed my other regression testing, but I was
traveling today and couldn't send my pull request.

I'll send it over the weekend, so hopefully it'll be merged shortly!

Did this end up getting sen to the list? I also validated updating to 
the specific hash resolved my issue too.

Just noticed the same issue is now happening on kirkstone, since the
kern-tools-native was also updated there.

Seems we're missing backporting
533720a1756454447341769c4a0969fce8d6f287 (kern-tools: fix relative
path processing).

Sakoman, is that one already on your list? Otherwise we can send it to
the list as well.

Thanks,
