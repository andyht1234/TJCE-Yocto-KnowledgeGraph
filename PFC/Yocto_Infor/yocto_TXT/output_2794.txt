I am trying to get PySimpleGUI running on an RPi4 using meta-raspberrypi with hardknott.

I have created a recipe for PySimpleGUI and added the following to my local.conf:

PACKAGECONFIG_pn-python3 = “tk”
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " python3 python3-modules python3-pysimplegui tk"

However, the tkinter module fails to load, reporting “No module named _tkinter”, with a note above saying that Python may not be configured for Tk.

Looking on the target, /usr/lib/libtk.8.so is present.

It looks as if there is something else I need to do to get Python to build correctly, but I’m out of ideas ;-)

I’ve found a few bits on the internet that seem related, but they haven’t helped me get things going:
 https://www.mail-archive.com/yocto@yoctoproject.org/msg18232.html
 https://www.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/2014-July/020547.html

Any pointers on where to look would be appreciated.

You need to add “tk” to the package config for python3
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/recipes-devtools/python/python3_3.9.6.bb#n110

Add the following to your distro|site|local.conf (or a python3_%.bbappend)

PACKAGECONFIG:append:pn-python3 = “ tk”

( replace : with _ if you are on old release that doesn’t support the new
override syntax)

(This assumes you have meta-oe in your bblayers.conf so you can build tk,
which it sounds like you do)

This is because the _tkinter .so built by python3 is dynamically loaded
only if present
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/recipes-devtools/python/python3/python3-manifest.json#n1161

Hi Tim,

Thanks, that’s got it going. I was close, but didn’t quite cast the correct spell ;-)

Next is to work out why the display is black when I create a window...
