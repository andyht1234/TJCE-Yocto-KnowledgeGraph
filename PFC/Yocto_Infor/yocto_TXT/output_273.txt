Hi,

we have been using a custom initramfs image in our Yocto BSP, the initramfs contains busybox and a custom init script to mount the ext4 based root filesystem and start the init process in the root file system using switch_root utility.
now we want to move to the systemd as our init manager, and so have few questions on the same.

1. when we choose an init manager whether it is typically installed on initramfs or the root file system?
2. what will be the expected size increase if we include the systemd in initramfs?
3. if we include the systemd in the initramfs whether the same should also be installed in the root file system, to manage the run time services?
4. if we include the systemd in the initramfs should the systemd in initramfs mount the root file system, and call the systemd init manager in the root file system?
5. or should we simply install the systemd in the root file system and use the initramfs to mount the file system and start systemd init manager?
6. is there any good BSP example that uses systemd and initramfs?

Basically we are thinking of two approaches,
1. I nstall the systemd in initramfs, and let the systemd mount the root file system.
2. retain our custom init script for mounting the root file system and invoke the systemd init process within the init script with switch_root utility.

which of the above method is the standard way?
