The goal of the default COMPATIBLE_MACHINE was to not allow
rockchip-rkbin to be even parsed if a MACHINE isn't part of the
COMPATIBLE_MACHINE.

However, COMPATIBLE_MACHINE is a regexp checked using Python's re module
approximately like:
"""
if re.match(COMPATIBLE_MACHINE, MACHINE):
	return True
"""

and re.match() returns a match whatever MACHINE is if COMPATIBLE_MACHINE
is the empty string.

Therefore, let's change it to `^$` which only matches the empty string,
which shouldn't be possible for anything in MACHINEOVERRIDES, and if it
is there are probably bigger problems than parsing rockchip-rkbin.
