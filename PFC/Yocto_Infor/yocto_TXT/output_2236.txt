Hello,

I am trying to get filenames with utf-8 chars to appear correctly when
doing the "ls" command. Currently, "ls" will output the filename but
replace the international char with "?".  For example it will output
"/tmp/h??llo"  rather than "/tmp/hallo"  (a with an umlaut).  If I set the
LANG=en_US.utf-8, that seems to fix the issue. But I have other embedded
devices (not built by Yocto)  that don't have LANG set that will output
correctly.

I have tried the kernel config  CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT="utf8", but that did not
help.  I have also added numerous the glibc-locale packages to the image
but that also doesn't seem to help.

"locale -a"  outputs  "C POSIX en_US en_US.utf8 es_ES ... (etc etc)"
"locale -m" outputs only  "UTF-8"
"localedef -c -f UTF-8 -i en_US en_US.UTF-8" seems to succeed.
"locale"  outputs "LANG=     LC_*="POSIX"   LC_ALL="

Any help is appreciated.
