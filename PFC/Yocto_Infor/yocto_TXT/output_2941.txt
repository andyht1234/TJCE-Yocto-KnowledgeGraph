Hi,

I've been playing with extensible SDK lately and got to a point, where I
want to create a minimal SDK installer and install all the required
packages in runtime via `devtool sdk-install`, so that every developer can
get only the stuff that's actually needed.

For the target part it works as expected, installing the content to
${OECORE_TARGET_SYSROOT}, however for the host part the content gets
installed to ${OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT}, but it's not visible in the PATH in
some cases. E.g. for perl-native the binaries are installed to `<native
sysroot>/bin/perl-native` and are not visible, unless I manually extend the
PATH with this directory, then it works fine.

So my questions are:
* Is the runtime installation of packages meant to run on host actually
supported? It surely works for e.g. compiler, so I assume it should be also
fine for other packages?
* Should I install `nativesdk-` or `-native` packages, if I want to use
them this way? Or can I actually do both? In the eSDK talk by Paul Eggerton
I saw that `nativesdk-cmake` was added, but the `nativesdk-` doesn't really
seem to fit `mini Yocto environment` that eSDK basically is.
* Am I possibly missing some configuration steps? In Yocto environment the
PATH gets expanded with `bin/perl-native` automatically, but I wasn't able
to pinpoint what file/task actually does it.

Best Regards and thanks in advance,
Jakub

Ok, I was able to find the answer to the third point:

The *bolded* sentence is not actually true. Adding *perl-native* to the *DEPENDS* of a recipe, does not cause it to be automatically picked up during the build. For this to happen the *perlnative* bbclass has to be inherited. Same design is in place for at least python, probably more packages.

This brings me to the followup question:
How can I mimic the *perlnative* or *python3native* behaviour on the eSDK level? Is this only possible via the *devtool* and recipes, and so can't be done "outside" of the Yocto environment, e.g. using ${CC} and ${CXX} variables?

Regards,
Jakub
