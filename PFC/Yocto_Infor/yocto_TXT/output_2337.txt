Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.5 M2 is due to build this week
*	Work has progressed on inclusive language and an email should be out
this week about the proposals for that after discussions amongst the
volunteers who stepped up to work on it. Some obsolete variables/code have
already been removed as a prelude to this.
*	Patches to switch to setuptools and away from distutils following
upstream python's lead have merered (thanks Tim!). Whilst the issues are
resolved for core, work remains on other layers such as meta-oe.
*	The autobuilder does look improved from an intermittent failure
perspective but we're seeing hangs for unknown reasons on debian9
oe-selftest (seems python pthread mutex related) and on ltp on the arm
worker. Sadly the open issues are at an all time high.
*	Patches to disable the network outside of do_fetch have merged.
*	Support for improved SPDX info for the kernel has merged (thanks
Saul).
*	CVE issues had a bad week with further significant increases for
master and stable branches. Some patches have merged to improve master
(thanks Ross!).
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at record high levels and help is
very much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
