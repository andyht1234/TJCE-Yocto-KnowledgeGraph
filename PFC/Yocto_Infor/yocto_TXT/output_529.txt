Hi,
how to scroll up/down in the yocto devshell (started with bitbake -c
devshell my-recipe)?

Scrolling with the mouse is scrolling through the command history instead
of through the terminal. Using shift + page up simply prints "~2". Using
"reset" doesn't fix it.

Environment: Ubuntu 22.04 with default terminal.

devshell is not a regular terminal window, but something running under
tmux or screen. Use ps to see what you got, then read the manpage for
it to see how to scroll :)

Thanks, using "ps -a" I found it's a tmux environment:
