Current Dev Position: YP 4.1 M3

Next Deadline: 22nd August 2022 YP 4.1 M3 Build

Next Team Meetings:

   -

   Bug Triage meeting Thursday August 4th 7:30 am PDT (
   https://zoom.us/j/454367603?pwd=ZGxoa2ZXL3FkM3Y0bFd5aVpHVVZ6dz09)
   -

   Weekly Project Engineering Sync Tuesday August  2nd  at 8 am PDT (
   https://zoom.us/j/990892712?pwd=cHU1MjhoM2x6ck81bkcrYjRrcmJsUT09)
   <https://zoom.us/j/990892712>
   -

   Twitch -  See https://www.twitch.tv/theyoctojester


Key Status/Updates:

   -

   YP 4.1 M2 was released
   -

   YP 3.1.18 passed QA and is due to be released
   -

   The debug file mapping issues have moved slightly further forward thanks
   to some help from Ross but are stalling due to insufficient developer time
   available to resolve the issues.
   -

   Some rust toolchain improvements did merge, including an automated rust
   toolchain test. The bulk of the rework is stalled on a handful of remaining
   issues, particularly a couple of reproducibility problems but also a mips
   n32 toolchain issue.
   -

   We have one open CVE on master against qemu, help to backport that fix
   would be very welcome to keep the numbers down. CVEs in kirkstone (LTS)
   significantly reduced.
   -

   Some development workflow changes around the eSDK workflow merged. There
   are also some layer workflow patches still pending review.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT


Ways to contribute:

   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.

Yes!  We have a patch under review for kirkstone:
https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/message/168636

I think Richard is hoping someone will see if that also will work on
master and if so send a patch.

Steve
