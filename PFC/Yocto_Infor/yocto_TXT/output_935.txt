Hi,

I'm running into a "is trying to install files into a shared area when 
those files already exist." error and am not sure how to resolve it. I 
get the following:

ERROR: linux-renesas-5.10.83-cip1+gitAUTOINC+e52825e45b-r1 
do_packagedata: The recipe linux-renesas is trying to install files into 
a shared area when those files already exist. Those files and their 
manifest location are:
/home/yocto/rzg_vlp_v3.0.0/build/tmp/pkgdata/smarc-rzg2l/runtime/kernel-module-cfg80211-5.10.83-cip1-yocto-standard

     (matched in

     (matched in 
manifest-smarc_rzg2l-kernel-module-lwb5p-backports-laird.packagedata)
Please verify which recipe should provide the above files.

It obviously has something to do with the drivers for the lwb5p laird 
module I'm trying to add.

How do I go about resolving this on my dunfell based build?

there are two recipes building same files which end up in same
location on target rootfs. So you should either disable the in-kernel
module or not include out of kernel module recipe

Okay Thanks, since it complains about 20211, it may be the following 
kernel config:
CONFIG_CFG80211=m

I'll remove it retry.
Thanks!
