Hi all,

I want to create .deb file of package python3-speechrecognition  , I  successfully builded natively on target board riscv platform and i copied binary from target board and with using  recipe i am copying binary in path: /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages and trying  to create .deb file from using yocto environment.

speechrecognition recipe is-

*DESCRIPTION = "speechrecognition Packages with dependencies library's "*

*LICENSE = "CLOSED"*

*SRC_URI += "file://speechrecognition"*

*S = "${WORKDIR}/speechrecognition"*

*do_install() {*
*install -d  ${D}${libdir}/*
*cp -r ${S}/lib/* ${D}${libdir}/*
*}*

*FILES_${PN} += "${libdir}/*"

* I am facing one issue here:-

*ERROR: speechrecognition-3.9.0-r0 do_populate_sysroot: Fatal errors occurred in subprocesses:*
*Command '['riscv64-oe-linux-strip', '--remove-section=.comment', '--remove-section=.note', '/home/kush/khu/sources/khu-build/tmp-glibc/work/riscv64-oe-linux/speechrecognition/3.9.0-r0/sysroot-destdir/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/flac-linux-x86']' returned non-zero exit status 1.*

That's not how it works. You need to write a recipe that cross-builds
the needed package from source. Taking prebuilt binaries from
elsewhere is asking for trouble, and not recommended even for
experienced developers.

I'll make a wild guess that the binary in "flac-linux-x86" is an x86
one and the riscv strip doesn't like x86 binaries.

I suspect your riscv target device doesn't like them much either.

Cheers,

Richard
