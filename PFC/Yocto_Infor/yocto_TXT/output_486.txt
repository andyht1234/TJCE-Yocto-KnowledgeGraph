Hi,

Since yesterday, we can't access https://www.yoctoproject.org/connectivity.html in China mainland. As a result, we can't build Yocto successfully with below Sanity check error.
It will be appreciated if you have any idea about this. Thanks~~

*Either fix the cause of this error or at your own risk disable the checker (see sanity.conf).*

*Please ensure your host's network is configured correctly.*

*Please ensure CONNECTIVITY_CHECK_URIS is correct and specified URIs are available.*

*If your ISP or network is blocking the above URL,*

*try with another domain name, for example by setting:*

The error message says what you should do:
CONNECTIVITY_CHECK_URIS = "https://www.example.com/"
in local.conf (or any other URL which is accessible in China mainland).
