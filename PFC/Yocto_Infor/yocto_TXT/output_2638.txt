My yocto builds started failing today (November 2, 2021) due to this 
(https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/#no-more-unauthenticated-git) 
issue.  Is there a fix for the yocto fetcher?  I using rocko.

There are patches in master-next for this. You can backport them, but you
really shouldn't be using rocko.
