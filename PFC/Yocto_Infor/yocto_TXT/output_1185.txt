Hi,

I'm interested in extracting the u-boot config from an existing BSP. It 
does compile u-boot but I cannot find the config file and I definitely 
can invoke bitbake u-boot separately, i.e. there must be a .config file 
somewhere.
Background: I want to be able to compile u-boot separately with make, 
outside of Yocto and re-use the same configuration.
Can anyone give me any hints?

Thanks,

Ron
