bitbake-layers show-appends reports:

  Summary: There were 3 WARNING messages.
  === Matched appended recipes ===
  kernel-module-nxp89xx_git.bb:
    /home/jklug/mlinux-kirk2/layers/meta-multitech-nxp/recipes-kernel/kernel-module-nxp89xx/kernel-module-nxp89xx_%.bbappend
  WARNING: kernel-module-nxp89xx.bb: missing append for preferred version

I have tried _git instead of _%.

I have also tried 1.0, since bitbake -e reports:

  PV="1.0"

What should I be doing?  Nothing in the bbappend does anything, unless I make it invalid, then I get an error.

SRCREV is set in this recipe as a hash.

I may be wrong but it looks like you have 2 kernel-module-nxp89xx recipes :
* one called kernel-module-nxp89xx_git.bb which is bbappended in you layer
* another one called kernel-module-nxp89xx.bb (no PV in filename), which is
preferred over the _git one.

I guess you an either :
* Use kernel-module-nxp89xx.bb : rename your bbappend to
kernel-module-nxp89xx.bbappend
* keep kernel-module-nxp89xx_git.bb : remove or inhibit
kernel-module-nxp89xx.bb

I have tried _git instead of _%.

This is indeed the case, and removing _git in the bbappend file name cured the problem.  Thanks.
