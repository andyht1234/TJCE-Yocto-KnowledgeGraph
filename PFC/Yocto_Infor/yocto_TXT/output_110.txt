Hi guys,
I am using yocto dunfell for my image. I am able to install nodejs 14 and
npm version 6.something.
I want it to instead install 9.8.1 with my image. At present I have to
manually install it after loading the image. Is there a way to update it in
the recipe file? My recipe file name is nodejs_12.22.12.bb.


Thanks and regards,
Hassan
