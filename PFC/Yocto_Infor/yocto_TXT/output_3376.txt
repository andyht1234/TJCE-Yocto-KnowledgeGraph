Hi,

Due to the Yocto Project Summit running during our regular OpenEmbedded Happy 
Hour today, we decided to move it down by 3 hours and have Happy Hour at the 
end of the Summit, May 26 @ 2000/8pm UTC (4pm ET / 1pm PT).

Please join us and socialize with fellow developers and have some good time.
