I am working with yoctoÂ  behind network proxy. Hence I want to pass the proxy variable (http_proxy) to recipe where cmake download some dependency. I tried to pass using BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE .. but i haven't succeeded. Can someone suggest better option

There are some examples in metadata where we explicitly disable this
download happening during do_configure step via FetchContent cmake
module. Its better to club all downloads in do_fetch so fetcher can
checksum and make sure that it's deterministic.
