Key Status/Updates:

   -

   The YP 4.3 (M4) rc1 build is still pending
   -

   YP 4.0.13 was released
   -

   For the 4.3 release, we have merged and switched to the 6.5 kernel. Many
   different fixes for issues merged but for one issue we have not found a fix
   and there are continuing serial console problems. Workarounds are in place
   but appear only partially successful.
   -

   Other 4.3 release blocking issues:
   -

      There are space issues with strace ptest images
      -

      There are QA regression report generation failures (patch in testing)
      -

      Busybox serial console handling is broken (patch in testing)
      -

      A curl CVE fix is due tomorrow
      -

   We hope to build 4.3 once these issues are resolved
   -

   A fix for the openssh ptest issue merged, thanks Mikko
   -

   The bblock/bbunlock patches have merged, thanks Julien
   -

   ttyrun merged, which improves serial console handling for images shared
   between different platform and addresses long standing issues, thanks Ross
   -

   ‘remove’ API for the hashequiv server merged, thanks Joshua
   -

Ways to contribute:

   -

   As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which
   are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to
   keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool,
   toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many
   have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
   components!
   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
