Hello Everybody, I need some space for another build. I was planning to delete an old build which I don't use anymore. It is in the Build folder. Can I basically delete Build folder? Does it contain anything used for other builds? Thank you.

It may contain sstate cache and downloads, which are useful across builds
and can significantly speed them up. I'd suggest you store them somewhere
else and point to them via settings in conf/local.conf in all of your
builds.
