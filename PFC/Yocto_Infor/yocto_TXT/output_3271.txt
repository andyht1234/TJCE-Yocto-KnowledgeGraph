Summary: Things are improving somewhat on the autobuilder,
          RCU stalls are the top problem now.


1.
LTP kernel BUG:
Many thanks to Paul Gortmaker for his work on this!


2. The most common problem now is the qemu RCU hang.

For example these builds:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/73/builds/3541/steps/13/logs/stdio

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/73/builds/3541/steps/13/logs/stdio

Richards links on RCU stall detection, and tuning parameters:
    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/RCU/stallwarn.txt
    https://lwn.net/Articles/777214/

Next:
  - Ask around for advice on qemu debugging.
  - RP thinks that the underlying system has a problem:
      CPU or other overload.
    We do see that there are two qemus that are using lots of CPU in
    the links above.
    Richard says that the likely activity is:
      - core-image-sato-sdk, compiler tests
      - core-image-sato  lighter general tests
    Alex thinks that the particular workload is not significant.
  - run two qemu in a controlled env, with stress-ng.
  - iostat will help - Sakib.

3. Valgrind ptest results are getting better.

4. ptest issues are coming along, with util-linux being the next
thing to be merged today likely.

5. On the ubuntu-18.04 builders, we seem to see issues there,
    we dont' know why, maybe only that we have more of those workers...
    Alex, could you possibly get failures per worker statistics?


6. discussed Sakib's summary script. It's coming along.
    TO DO:
    - special activities: rm (of trash), tar, qemu*
    - report all zombies
      (The current hoard are due to Paul Barker's patch)
7.
make: job server
  - the fifo was being re-created by the wrapper on each call
    so Trevor will fix that.



8. From last week, I don't think we've increased the timeouts:

  - qemu-runner? timeout increase 120 -> 240
  - ptest timeouts 300 -> 450?




8.
   Plans for the week:

   Richard: RCU stall
   Alex:
   Sakib: task summary
   Trevor: make job server
   Tony: ptests and work with upstream valgrind on fixing bugs.
   Saul: (1 week) have QMP deal with sigusr1 to close the QMP socket
   Randy: coffee, herd cats!!

Specifically for bug 14273 (the rcu stall is seen on the logs):

ubuntu1804-ty-1    6   23.1%
ubuntu1804-ty-2    5   19.2%
ubuntu1804-ty-3   12   38.5%
fedora31-ty-1      2    7.7%
debian8-ty-1       3   11.5%
