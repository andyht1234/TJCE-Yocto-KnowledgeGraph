Hi everyone,

I'm curious on a good approach when dealing with multiple projects

I've just started out  yocto and have already  created our own meta-layer which contains our modules. Now these modules would sometimes have config files and this could vary when each project that we have would use these recipes. I'm thinking of a way to control this. And I don't think having one branch per project is a good style. Right now the best way I can think of is creating seperate "project layers" (ex. meta-project1, meta-project2) and from there create those .bbappends which would point to the project-specific conf files.

But I was wondering if there is a better way of handling it. Thanks.

Cheers.

You left a few details out about how the configuration files are managed.
Ideally you could just make bitbake recipes for the config files
themselves. This way you can create an image recipe for each project and
use the IMAGE_INSTALL variable to append whatever configs and modules you
want on a per-project basis.

sorry about that, right now the config files are placed in the files directory of the recipe which builds the module.

Sample snippets of the recipe concerning this config file, I removed the rest of lines.
SRC_URI = " \
file://config.json \
"

do_install_append() {
install -m 0644 ${WORKDIR}/config.json ${D}/etc/directory/
}

If I were to have the config files placed on a separate recipe, would that mean making multiple of these recipes depending on the number of projects?
I did thought also of adding it in the image recipe but probably this wouldn't look well if more things get added.

Thanks

We have many recipes appended to IMAGE_INSTALL in our image recipes and it
works just fine.

From your description, it sounds like you could go either way. I personally
prefer to keep my image recipes as clean as possible, so I push as much as
I can to individual recipes. This helps with debugging later on as your
project (inevitably) gets more complex.

Also... Experience has shown that the following form is a lot more readable:

IMAGE_INSTALL  = "recipe_1"
IMAGE_INSTALL += "recipe_2"
IMAGE_INSTALL += "recipe_3"
IMAGE_INSTALL += "recipe_4"
IMAGE_INSTALL += "recipe_5"

Than this:

IMAGE_INSTALL = "\
         recipe_1 \
         recipe_2 \
         recipe_3 \
         recipe_4 \
         recipe_5"

When your repository grows large, a recursive grep for recipe_2 will make a
lot more sense if "IMAGE_INSTALL += "recipe_2"" is returned instead of
"recipe_2 \". The latter form gives no clue as to how recipe_2 is being
referenced.
