This series is a follow-up for the 4.3_M1.rc1 regression report issue.

It has been observed that the report is empty. This issue is linked to
configuration description in yocto-autobuilder-helper, and has been
identified through the following steps:
- empty report is supposed to be a comparison between yocto-4.2 (4.2.rc3)
  and 4.3_M1.rc1
- yocto-4.2 results are almost empty: we only find test results from Intel
  QA (pushed _after_ the AB build) and not the AB test results
- tests results are managed by send-qa-email.send-qa-email uses resulttool
  to systematically gather and store test results in local git directory
- however, it looks for basebranch/comparebranch to know if those results
  can be pushed onto git server, and those variables depend on config.json
  content
- yocto-4.2 (4.2.rc3) has been built on release branch mickledore
  (https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/83/builds/5212)
- since mickledore is not yet described in config.json, send-qa-email
  considers it as a "work" branch (contrary to a "release" branch) and does
  not push test results

As a consequence:
- first commit brings in python logger
- second commit adds a warning when such case happen, since we are able to
  detect it
- third fix actually adds mickledore as a release branch to properly store
  again test results

There must be a more robust rework to do (because the issue will likely
happen on each major delivery), but I aimed for the quick and small fix to
quickly bring back tests results storage without breaking other things in
the process

Alexis Lothoré (3):
  scripts/send-qa-email: use logger instead of raw prints
  scripts/send-qa-email: print warning when test results are not stored
  config.json: add mickledore as direct push branch for test results

As for other scripts in yocto-autobuilder-helper or oecore, use python
logger class instead of raw print calls to allow log level distinction

Tests results push command depends on basebranch and comparebranch
variables, which are computed based on config.json content. If this file is
not in sync with current release branch, tests results will be properly
stored in git directory but not pushed onto test results server. Since we
are able to detect this scenario, print at least a warning, without
breaking current build since it could be a release

Now that mickledore is released, builds are executed on mickeldore release
branch. If not properly described in config.json, it will be considered a
"work" branch, and as a consequence test results will not be pushed onto
test results git repository
Add mickeldore entry in config.json to fix test results storage

Example of such failure is AB build 5212
(https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/83/builds/5212/steps/29/logs/stdio)
for yocto-4.2 (mickledore release), which lead to empty regression report
for 4.3_M1.rc1 since it was compared to 4.2

Thanks for the analysis. I agree we need to somehow fix this properly.
One solution might be to always push for poky if the branch name
doesn't end with -next?

Since we have the release artefacts for the release, could we add the
test results after the fact now?

Id' be interested to see the 4.3 M1 to 4.2 comparison rerun with that
added.

Cheers,

Richard

That might work indeed. If we are sure enough that no custom/feature branch will
be used in poky with send-qa-email (ie, only in poky-contrib), I can do the fix
this way

I am not sure about where to find those artifacts for yocto-4.2 ? If you are
referring to https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/, yocto-4.2 has already been
removed from there. And if you are referring to the archived release on main
site
(https://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-4.2/poky-21790e71d55f417f27cd51fae9dd47549758d4a0.tar.bz2),
it does contain a single, 40 line testresults.json, so that's definitely not the
full AB tests results.

I sometimes use a different branch name when testing things out (like 64
bit time) but as long as we all know, we can probably ensure this ends in
-next.

That would always be in poky-contrib though?

Thanks, I've merged this as it is a good first set of steps.

As I mentioned, I think we should hardcode poky + "not ending with -
next" as the test, then we shouldn't run into this issue again.

I'd also like to retroactively push the test results for 4.2 since we
have them and should be able to merge them onto the branch. I'd then
like to see what the revised 4.3 M1 report looks like.

Cheers,

Richard

I have started importing the archive kindly prepared by Michael in poky-contrib
test-results repository, but I am struggling a bit regarding regression report
generation with freshly imported result. I still have to confirm if it is the
generated tag that is faulty or if it is a kind of an edge case in resulttool

Kind regards,

So, I have managed to generate the regression report locally (there's likely a
tag issue for older tests stored in test-results to be circumvented in
resulttool), and it is a bit disappointing. The report is 13MB large, and is
filled once again with false positive likely due to non static ptest names,
likely due to leaky build logs. Here's a sample

ptestresult.gcc-g++-user.c-c++-common/Wbidi-chars-ranges.c  -std=gnu++14
expected multiline pattern lines 13-17 was found: "\s*/\*<U\+202E> \}
<U\+2066>if \(isAdmin\)<U\+2069> <U\+2066> begin admins only \*/[^\n\r]*\n
~~~~~~~~                                ~~~~~~~~                    \^\n

\|[^\n\r]*\n       \|                                       \|
        end of bidirectional context[^\n\r]*\n       U\+202E \(RIGHT-TO-LEFT
OVERRIDE\)         U\+2066 \(LEFT-TO-RIGHT ISOLATE\)[^\n\r]*\n": PASS -> None
    ptestresult.gcc-g++-user.c-c++-common/Wbidi-chars-ranges.c  -std=gnu++14
expected multiline pattern lines 26-31 was found: "     /\* end admins only
<U\+202E> \{ <U\+2066>\*/[^\n\r]*\n                        ~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~
\^\n                        \|          \|        \|[^\n\r]*\n

      U\+202E \(RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE\)[^\n\r]*\n": PASS -> None

Most of this noise is about gcc ptests, there is also a bit about python3 and
ltp. I manually trimmed gcc false positive to reach a reasonable size, here it is:

Thanks for getting us the diff!

Going through the details there, most of it is "expected" due to
changes in version of the components. I did wonder if we could somehow
show that version change?

I'm starting to wonder if we should:

a) file two bugs for cleaning up the python3 and gcc test results
b) summarise the python3 and gcc test results in the processing rather
than printing in full if the differences exceed some threshold (40
changes?)

Basically we need to make this report useful somehow, even if we have
to exclude some data for now until we can better process it.

I'm open to other ideas...

Cheers,

Richard

I would say yes and yes, and I like the idea of setting a general threshold,
either an absolute one or as a percentage of total number of test cases in
current test.

Absolutely. I will use this report as a base to bring a new batch of
improvements. I will also add the stats I have been talking about earlier, to
know for example if for a test case, the generated noise is really affecting the
whole test or is a drop in the sea
