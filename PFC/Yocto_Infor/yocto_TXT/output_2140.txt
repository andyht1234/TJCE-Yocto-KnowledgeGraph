I have a requirement to create production and release builds for the
same machine. Debug build would use most of the production recipes,
except few images like Linux kernel that will have debug configs
enabled and a separate debug image is created.  Also debug images will
have few extra debug packages and image features like debug-tweaks
enabled. What is the standard way of managing this ?
One other requirement is that for e.g. I do not want both debug and
production linux images to be created in one build. That increases the
build time. i.e. just adding debug variant recipes alone does not
suffice.
Also the debug and production variants are not specific to a machine,
i.e. tomorrow if I add another machine, I should be able to generate
both variants for that machine too without any machine conf changes.

What I have tried right now is to create 2 local.conf, one in
meta/conf and other in meta/conf/debug. The debug conf has an
IMAGE_FEATURE indicating that it is a debug variant. I am using the
debug-tweaks image feature as of now. And then I switch the confs with
TEMPLATECONF. Now, for recipes, I have not created separate debug
recipes. For e.g. in the linux recipe I am just looking for the
debug-tweaks feature to pick the right config fragments.

Thanks,
Vinayak

Hi Vinayak

I believe that the best way to prepare debug and prod images is to create
include file (.inc) with base set of packages and features and then add two
.bb recipes, one for prod and one for debug - every of this recipes will need
to include the `.inc` file. You could name them `base-image-prod.bb` and
`base-image-debug.bb`. This way you could run either prod or debug builds
by running `bitbake base-image-debug` or `bitbake base-image-prod`.

As for the machine, this would need to be set in local.conf every time you want
to switch the machine. To simplify this process, for the management of the
configuration of the entire build (including the selection of debug / prod image
or machine configuration), I recommend the kas[1] project with the very helpful
kas-container tool.

Thanks Tomasz. I will check kas.
Yes, for selecting some of the packages I have created prod and debug
image recipes.
But this did not work for the kernel as the kernel recipe is picked as
part of PROVIDER
in machine conf. SoI had to use 2 conf to have the IMAGE_FEATURES (or
any other var)
set differently for prod and debug. This is for building the kernel
recipie differently for prod
and debug. Setting the IMAGE_FEATURES in the image recipe (and not in
conf) causes
2 problems. One is that kernel and other bootloaders recipes are
picked early via PROVIDER
 in conf and not as packages included in image recipe. Secondly,
setting the var in the image
recipe breaks this command for e.g. "bitbake base-image-prod.bb
base-image-debug.bb".
Since the command parses the recipes only once for both image creation.

If you can't do what you need with only image recipes, then the only
option is to create an additional DISTRO config I'm afraid. Putting
these tweaks into machine config or local.conf is not correct.

What are the difference there? You want to use different config on prod and debug images?
Maybe add it as config fragments? Then you would need to add some global variable to
distinguish when use given .cfg file.

Is that a problem?

Didn't you want to distinguish this to builds to be able to run `bitbake base-image-prod` or
`bitbake base-image-debug`?

Nevertheless I would greatly recommend you to use kas. In simple .yml file you
could prepare different `local.conf` per configuration prod/debug.

This concept of user vs debug builds is there in Android and any
Android developer who gets introduced to yocto may look for these
options. There seem to be many implementation choices here, trying to
summarize some of the options here.

1. use different image recipes example-image-user.bb vs
example-image-debug.bb but this still poses a problem for kernel
recipes as kernel needs to have different config fragments or
different defconfig for debug vs user variants. One possible option is
to use KTYPE to select tiny vs standard or define own for custom BSP
layers. What about other recipes like u-boot or firmware for other
remote processors, how to percolate the debug vs user options to those
recipes via just an image recipe ?
2. use different configs using multiconfig. Base config (which is
debug) also selects the user config hence always building both build
variants in different tmp directories. Kernel, remote firmware and
image recipes use variables from the multiconfig cof files to decide
whether to build debug or user variants.
3. use different distros. DSITRO=user bitbake example-image,
DISTRO=debug example-image. Kernel and remote firmware recipes use
variables from the distro to decide whether to build debug or user
variants.

Which is the best method ?
All these options seem very BSP layer specific, is there something
more generic and better than the above options ?
If not, should this be a feature request to the Yocto project ?

NOTE: debug variants may include the following.
- more debug related kernel configs and security loosened and UART
ports disabled
- image recipe debug variant may include debug utilities absent from
the user variant

There could be more than just debug and user variants. Android has
engineering, tests, user, tiny and user-debug.

As a recipe cannot affect another recipe, and image recipes are obviously
recipes too, this is usually not useful.

The whole point of multiconfig is builds depending on each other. I don’t
think it applies here.

This is clearly the standard way.

Easily archived with 3.

See 3. You can have an arbitrary number of distros, interrelated however
you wish.
