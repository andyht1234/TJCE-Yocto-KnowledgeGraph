I did look at it. It was using a modified oe-selftest with threading instead of
multiprocess. We're not using that so I closed it.

Cheers,

Richard

I was looking at two issues prior to the meeting.  Sadly, due to
inadequate caffeine blood levels and the early hour I confused the
two. So this explains why I couldn't find the logs during the meeting.
So nothing to post  :-(
