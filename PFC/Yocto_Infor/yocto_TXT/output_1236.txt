Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.0.5 was released.
*	There have been a number of important CVEs (e.g. the recent openssl
one) which are merging to branches as they are ready, we suggest people keep
an eye on the branches.
*	Patches continue to flow steadily into master.
*	The CVEs in master continue to fall and patches are flowing into the
other stable branches.
*	We are making some progress with patch submission upstream,
including gcc. This does sometimes mean helping resolve other issues those
patches then introduce which can be time consuming, thanks go to all helping
work on this.
*	The number of AB-INT issues continues to be of concern, we're
working to try and resolve the most frequently occurring issues to enable
cleaner test runs but could use help.
*	We do have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, for example a
number of rust bugs were opened recently. We are probably at an all time low
on numbers of people able to work on bugs too which is a worrying
combination.
*	If anyone is working on features for 4.2, please do let us know
about them so we can plan accordingly. Even an idea of what is coming is
helpful to plan.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.2. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.2_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
