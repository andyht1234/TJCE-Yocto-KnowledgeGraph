These services are now available.

downloads.yoctoproject.org
sstate.yoctoproject.org

Restoring sources.openembedded.org is in process and it will be
available shortly.

Autobuilder workers will be available tomorrow.

All of the autobuilder workers are now back online and building.

The move is nearly complete. All machines except 1 survived despite some

rebuild it tomorrow.
