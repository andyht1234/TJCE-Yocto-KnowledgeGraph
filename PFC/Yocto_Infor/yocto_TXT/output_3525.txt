Cross-posting to yocto since this is of general interest.

We (Wind River) already drop the x11 DF from some of our distros and
we'd likely do the same for wayland and opengl so while this seems
like the wrong change for headless systems it is one we could deal with.

There was some discussion about this topic on the tech call today and
people were concerned about BSP support for opengl since the software
rendering in mesa is horridly slow.

Kevin, Bryan,
Can you comment if you think we'd have any show-stopper problems
with opengl support for BSPs?

Joshua said that weston has a usable RDP (remote desktop backend) but
I'm not sure how usable it is especially for single application sharing.
This contrasts with x11 where you can use X11 forwarding over
ssh trivially for whole desktops or an application.

In conclusion, I see the value in pushing yocto forward but we may need
to wait for agreement from BSP folks so let's see what they say.

Adding wayland seems Ok but forcing the opengl support doesn't seems a
good default. Especially because we just also ensure software
rendering is also wrong (slow or not).

Wait a moment, I am not sure I understand the argument about software
rendering. Can you please elaborate?

What is the scenario where enabling opengl would regress from something
hw-accelerated to software rendering?

Err, are they going to check my BSP ; )

The layer index  BSP list is long so waiting for feedback may not be
practical.  I think it may be  more of an awareness and how can the BSP
maintainers work around the default if there are issues rather than 
stopping this progress  in core.

I personal would rather see my layer break so that I will be forced to
take action.  I see this as being  no different than when we update
u-boot or the kernel.

Thanks for the notice. Hmm, it seems that we have done little validation
for the weston image on the Yocto BSPs, I got a boot failure with the
weston image on my beaglebone black board. I will try to figure out what is
wrong there. But I don't think it should block the change in this patch.

Thanks,
Kevin
