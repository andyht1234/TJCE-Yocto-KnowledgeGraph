Hello again to YOCTO Folks,

Here is another blunder I ran into while fixing a yocto-setup.sh script:
https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/bbb-yocto/blob/master/yocto-setup.sh

While executing $  . ./yocto-setup.sh dunfell, everything ran smoothly.

I did the same routine with the $  . ./yocto-setup.sh gatesgarth, and
approximately after:
Parsing recipes: 9% |##########

The following message pops up!
Loading cache: 100% |
                                                | ETA:  --:--:--
Loaded 0 entries from dependency cache.
ERROR: ParseError at
/home/vuser/projects_yocto/bbb-yocto-gatesgarth/meta-bbb/images/console-image.bb:4:
Could not include required file images/basic-dev-image.bb

Summary: There was 1 WARNING message shown.
Summary: There was 1 ERROR message shown, returning a non-zero exit code.

If you peek into the following github repos:
https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-bbb
https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-jumpnow

You'll see that in later  images/basic-dev-image.bb does exist, as
well as in the dunfell branch:
https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-jumpnow/blob/zeus/images/basic-dev-image.bb

As well as in gatesgarth branch:
https://github.com/jumpnow/meta-jumpnow/blob/gatesgarth/images/basic-dev-image.bb

What I see upon the logic, something changes in poky/ setup, while
transitioning from dunfell to gatesgarth.

I also have created an issue in bbb-yocto repo:
https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/bbb-yocto/issues/3

I would appreciate any ideas or hints...  Maybe some changes required
in local.conf ?

You can all try it yourselves, and see the same!

Thank you,
Zoran

The layer is not included. Check in your bblayers.conf. see https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/bbb-yocto/blob/a6e8e8ce491705816d02df58fa0ef9378b18ef83/yocto-setup.sh#L114 where you are missing the gatesgarth check.

Cheers,
Quentin

Hello Quentin,

Thank you for finding the bug. It was in front of my eyes (I print all
the layers at the end of setup, but I missed to compare bb-layers from
dunfell with bb-layers from gatesgarth).

I should do better. With regards to testing thinking. ;-)
_______

Now, there are other bugs (I should say, new features introduced).

Seems that this line in local.conf got severely changed, or most
likely the DHCP package version/handling got changed:

CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL_append = "openssh dhcp-libs dhcp-server
dhcp-server-config dhcp-client dhcp-relay dhcp-omshell cmake
libsocketcan nfs-utils rt-tests strace procps
packagegroup-core-buildessential "

The question is: what should I include in the
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL_append for the DHCP package for gatesgarth
and later releases???

Thank you,
Zoran

Or, maybe, now the DHCP is included in the releases by default?

Thank you,

If I remember correctly, dhcp-server has been replaced by kea, check on that side maybe. Read the migration notes, pretty sure the kea thing is listed there.
