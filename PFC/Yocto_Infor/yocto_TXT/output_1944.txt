The main issue I am facing now is how to go around the "UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa0 in position 99: invalid start byte" for the html script and the "UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 158: invalid continuation byte error" for the css script I get after the script has edited some of the files in the folder containing the outdate versions, but it works perfectly in all the other directories I tested in on.
But this error comes after some html and css files have successfully been edited by the script.

This is an RFC
missed putting that in the main patch.

Sorry for the filenames, trial.py contains the script that modifies the .html files while trialstyle.py contains that for the .css files.
