Hello,

I am trying to set a default size for the rootfs.jffs2 generated by Yocto.
For this purpose, if I am not wrong, this can be done using the 
IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE option.

But whereÂ  I have to configure this option ? So, in which configuration 
file ?
It seems that this detail has not been specified in the reference manual.

Thanks,
Simon
