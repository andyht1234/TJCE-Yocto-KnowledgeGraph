Hello:

If I am building an image "image-ABC", and it is composed of a number recipes, and for some of these recipes I may NOT want to install their final components within my image...

Which is the best place to modify the build with bbappend ?

Would I modify a recipe's do_install (do_install_append-recipe_xyz) ?, or would I modify the image recipe (do_install_append-image_ABC) I am leaning this way to avoid cases where the component recipes might have bbappends in place already ?

Looking for the proper Yocto way...

Thanks,
Steve
