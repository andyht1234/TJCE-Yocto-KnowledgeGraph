  while the dev manual insists that "virtual/" dependencies are only
for build-time deps and not run-time deps, i ran across this example
on the meta-intel master branch, under
dynamic-layers/openembedded-layer/recipes-oneapi/ (blank lines added
for clarity):

$ grep -r "RDEPENDS.*virtual/" *

compiler/intel-oneapi-compiler_2023.0.0-25370.bb:RDEPENDS:${PN} +=
"perl elfutils virtual/opencl-icd level-zero-loader zlib tbb libelf
setup-intel-oneapi-env"

dpcpp-compiler/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-cpp-runtime_2023.1.0-46305.bb:RDEPENDS:${PN}
+= "virtual/opencl-icd zlib tbb level-zero-loader bash tcsh"

mkl/intel-oneapi-mkl_2023.0.0-25398.bb:RDEPENDS:${PN} += "bash tbb
intel-oneapi-compiler setup-intel-oneapi-env virtual/opencl-icd"

  i have no opinion on it, just observing that it seems to fly in the
face of the rules laid down in the dev manual:

Correct, you’ve found a bug.

It’s unconventional to use virtual/ as runtime names. The root of the bug is here:

meta-oe/recipes-core/opencl/opencl-icd-loader_git.bb:RPROVIDES:${PN} = "virtual/opencl-icd”

That should be virtual-opencl-icd and the change pushed to all the dependent recipes.
