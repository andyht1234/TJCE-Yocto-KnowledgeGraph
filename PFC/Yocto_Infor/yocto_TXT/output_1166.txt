Hi,

I have intermittent problems with a recipe that creates a user that is member of groups that are created by a different recipe. This is the recipe that creates the groups:

# recipe-a.bb
inherit useradd
USERADD_PACKAGES = "${PN}"
GROUPADD_PARAM:${PN} = "--system gpio;--system i2c"

This is the recipe that creates the user:

# recipe-b.bb
inherit useradd
USERADD_PACKAGES = "${PN}"
GROUPADD_PARAM:${PN} = "--system mygroup"
GROUPS = "dialout,mygroup,gpio,i2c"
USERADD_PARAM:${PN} = "--system --no-create-home --shell /bin/false --no-user-group --groups ${GROUPS} myuser"
DEPENDS = "recipe-a"

I guess it's also worth pointing out, that I use useradd-static:
USERADDEXTENSION = "useradd-staticids"
USERADD_ERROR_DYNAMIC = "error"
USERADD_UID_TABLES = "files/passwd"
USERADD_GID_TABLES = "files/group"

Every now and then I get and error in recipe_b's do_package_setscene task where useradd complains that one of the groups provided by recipe_a does not exist. This appears to be a race condition since most of the times, this works OK. I was under the impression that specifying DEPENDS="recipe-a" in recipe_b.bb would be enough to declare this dependency. What am I doing wrong?

Best regards,
Sven

Just to confirm, this is with master?

I think there are some open bugs for useradd issues like this. It is
supposed to work but sounds like there are races. If there isn't a bug
open for it, there probably should be.

Sadly we don't have many people interested in working on issues like
this so I can't say when it might get fixed, we do our best!

Cheers,

Richard

One way I have gotten around this is by using an .inc file to create the
users/groups and then the recipes that need the user/group require/include
that .inc file.

https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13904 is one of the bugs
I think.

This is another:
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13419

Workarounds are not difficult, but the issue occurring for the first
time must be very disorienting.

Hi all,

Thanks for the pointers. I'm actually on kirkstone-4.0. I'll try the work-arounds.

Best regards,
Sven
