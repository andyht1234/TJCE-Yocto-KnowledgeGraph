Hi,
* I'm aware that yocto picks up packages from respective open source community. For e.g. dbus package is picked from freedesktop.org etc. In this regard, what kind of tests does yocto runs to ensure that the package that is getting picked-up is stable enough?
* Is it Yocto, that writes pTest's to ensure that the package that is getting picked up is stable enough?
* I could find pTest report for e.g. on Dunfell @ http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-3.1.1/testreport.txt (Refer "qemuarm64 PTest Result Summary" or "qemux86-64 PTest Result Summary" section for details). The test report only details the number of pTest's that passed, failed or skipped for respective package. Is there any report that *details* the pTest's, which failed, passed or skipped?
Additionally, I'm looking for pTest's for systemd, udev and glibc packages.
Below are my observations on these packages w.r.t pTests.
* pTest for systemd package has been removed with http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/meta/recipes-core/systemd?h=dunfell&id=40db00818e3b1cce8aa85ee30f3081ae9a5f8e66 commit.
* Similarly pTest for udev has been removed with http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/meta/recipes-core?h=dunfell&id=3e5e540513665105b963262c2eaf33f197a0a36c.
* I don't find ptest's for glibc package either.
As there aren't any pTests for these three packages, are there any other existing tests that can be run to validate these packages?

Thanks,
Ravi

there is system integration testing that happens on autobuilders which 
you can check reports for

ptests are generic and one can add more to a package but usually you 
will see that its trying to run the unit tests of the given package in a 
cross environment.

the detailed run logs would be available when you run it, I am not sure 
if we preserve those in release notes.

yes someone needs to step up and get ptests working with meson on these 
packages, they are temporarily removed there.

there is glibc-testsuite package which provides glibc testing.
