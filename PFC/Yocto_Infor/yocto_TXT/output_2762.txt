I think looking into buildhistory metadata might give some hints, it 
stores the information about image to package dependencies in a dotty 
file which you can either open in a viewer or text editor and see who 
might be pulling the package which provides file utility. So firstly you 
have to find which package provides file utility which could be done via 
oe-pkg-utils tool
