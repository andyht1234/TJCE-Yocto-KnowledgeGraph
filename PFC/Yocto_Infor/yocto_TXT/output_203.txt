Hi all,
I am using *"Mickledore 4.2.3"* for *"Raspberry-Pi2"* and for init I am using the default " *SysVinit".* I want to start my Script/Application immediately after starting and disable all logs. Please tell me how I can implement this in YOCTO. *
*

Thanks
Shrikant Vaishnav

First, write an init script as usual with any sysv-using Linux system (for example, https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/20361).  In your recipe install it to /etc/init.d and then use the update-rcd class to register it (https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/classes.html#update-rc-d).

Searching poky for the update-rc.d class will give you many examples.

Copying the list, I don’t do private support.

Editing inittab is a bad idea.

That’s an on-target location.  Something like:

SRC_URI = “file://myinitscript <file://myinitscript/>”

do_install() {
	mkdir —parents ${sysconfdir}/init.d
	install ${WORKDIR}/myinitscript ${sysconfdir}/init.d
}

Write the init script and install it in the recipe for your application, or write a new recipe if there isn’t a single obvious recipe.

The update-rcd class is needed to construct the symlinks for sysv to work.  If you don’t know what I’m talking about then read up on how SysV init scripts work: this isn’t Yocto-specific but a Unix standard since 1983.
