Hi all,

my dunfell build for a NVIDIA Jetson TX2 (support from meta-tegra) is failing in the way described here:

    https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/topic/86571641#55134.

As per a comment of Richard Purdie, it should already be fixed. I seem still affected, though.

I digged into it and suspect I might have to backport [3] to the glibc version used in dunfell, which is 2.31. I would still like to hear your thoughts about this. There should be quite a few people affected by this, rather than just me. Hence I'm likely miss something to the complete story.

The bug ticket ( https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14519 ) explains that the bug got introduced with [1], and is fixed with [2] and [3].

    [1] https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/commit/?id=4aa4dcd5f31657073f2207a9a4a43247322c7eb1
    [2] https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/commit/?id=06d55ee67ef81a9f9da178b06bb797cc62881643
    [3] https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/commit/?id=234a3e84640c1bb6df5fa4d3d7089a854b19d108

Poky dunfell contains [1] as 83b827e3d6835ef62cb2db3fc7505679ae727529 and [2] as a28d37580a1ae34d6c170490be420c7812d2b3e6 but not [3]. [3] patches glibc 2.34, while poky dunfell contains 2.31.

Best regards,
Manuel

It's not about glibc version used in target builds on dunfell, but about
glibc version used to build uninative tarball.

If you're using older docker daemon to run your builds, then easiest fix is
to upgrade to latest which contains the fix or as work around use
privileged containers.
