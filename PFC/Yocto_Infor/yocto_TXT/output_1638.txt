Dear All

Good Morning!

In my project, I am trying to create one custom image recipe in my yocto
build system.

 The reason of creating custom image is  -> having few specific
configurations for kernel and some specific driver Makefile changes to
enable coverage.

 I cannot go with .bbappend file, because we are maintaining a
recipes-append folder in our meta-layer which is common for all the
production build image recipes.

 My change is very specific it should not come as part of normal build
images because it will affect the production build.

 My use case:

1. I have one .cfg file for kernel - which has kernel specific
configurations.

2. I have Makefile changes for driver file.

 I should bring the above changes to kernel and  driver Makefile during
build time without using .bbappend file.

 I want to create a custom image recipe with the specific changes.

 For example : custom_image.bb =( This recipes should have
core_image_minimal.bb + my specific changes)

 When i build bitbake custom_image.bb,  it should  build  with
core_image_minimal.bb + my specific changes .

Other images recipes also should not affect by this changes.

My humble request. Can anyone please support how to proceed?

Kindly share your suggestions.

 *Regards*

*Senthamilarasi. M*

If the change is private to you, then you can make a simple layer and
make all the needed modifications there. Is this not possible?

Hi Alexander,

This is not my private change,so i cannot create my own layer. Without
creating layer and .bbappend file should implement.

Can anyone please support?

Hi Alexandre,

I am not pushing any changes to open source kernel. I want to enable few
driver module in the kernel. That configuration want to have in file/
folder.

My changes.

Hi Alexandre,

Good Morning!


I am not introducing any change to kernel.



This is one of my project requirement to enable coverage support to kernel
for specific build for my project.



In my project, Already we have few image recipes.

Ex: core_image_minimal.bb core_image_a.bb core_image_b.bb



These image recipes are using same kernel  with same configuration, Apart
from default kernel configuration, I want to enable few driver support in
kernel to enable coverage support for specific requirement.


To enable coverage support in kernel, I have added coverage.cfg in
meta-layer.

Ex: /recipes-kernel/linux-msm/files/coverage.cfg



cat coverage.cfg

CONFIG_GCOV=y

CONFIG_DEBUG_FS=y

CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL=y



If I add coverage.cfg in my kernel recipe(snippet below) - It will be taken
for all the image build. Whenever do bitbake of following recipe -
core_image_minimal.bb, core_image_a.bb, core_image_b.bb



The below changes will be added to the build, since this kernel is common
for all the image recipes(core_image_minimal.bb core_image_a.bb
core_image_b.bb).



Recipe content:



+++ b/recipes-kernel/linux-kernel/linux-kernel_5.x.bb

@@ -21,6 +21,7 @@ SRC_URI = "\

           file://audio-kpi.cfg \

           file://ptp-virtual.cfg \

           file://xfs.cfg \

+          file://coverage.cfg \

           ${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'systemd', '
file://systemd.cfg', '', d)} \

           ${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'virtualization', '
file://virtualization.cfg', '', d)} \





 Similarly, I have patch for file other recipes.



 In my case, I should not add this change to all the image build.


My requirement:

I want to create separate image recipe. Ex: core_image_myrecipe.bb



In this recipes

- I should include "inherit core-image-minimal" + "My specific
coverage_support changes".

As per project requirement, I should not create a separate meta layer to
maintain this patches.



Can you please help for creating a separate image recipe with specific
changes?


Regards

Senthamilarasi.M

It is not possible to modify a recipe from another recipe. Meaning you 
cannot decide which config file to use for the kernel from the image recipe.

You have however two options:
  - only include this configuration file for a given machine (you 
therefore need a new machine). This makes sense if the actual target HW 
is different,
  - only include this configuration file for a given distro (you 
therefore need a new distro file). This makes sense if the actual target 
HW is the same for all configuration file of your kernel, just that they 
differ in terms of "policy".

If you're trying to build "a debug image", it is most likely a new 
distro you're after.

However, there could be a way to still do this with images and that is 
with the use of kernel modules. The plan would be to *always* build 
GCOV, DEBUG_FS and GCOV_KERNEL as modules (if even possible?). Yocto 
actually splits kernel modules in their own packages. Therefore, you 
could have the default configuration for your kernel used in all images, 
but have your special coverage image include also 
kernel-module-gcov/debug-fs/gcov-kernel/etc.. packages and 
modprobe/insmod them at boot when needed.

Cheers,
Quentin
