Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.5 M2 finally built today after a number of autobuilder build
issues and is now in QA
*	Building M2 was fairly painful as various sstate error/warning code
paths were exposed in release builds, there were some infrastructure issues,
some test reporting bugs and other bugs like that in systemtap on arm and a
reproducibility issue, all of which combined to break the release builds in
different ways. Hopefully most of these are now addressed or in the process
of being fixed/tested.
*	Upstream glibc are planning to remove prelink support in 2.35 with
<https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2022-January/135565.html>
patches proposed on their mailing list. The project is unlikely to be able
to continue to maintain any prelink support once this happens and we will
therefore remove our prelink support before the next LTS unless the
situation changes and maintainers step forward.
*	An
<https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/message/160881> email
proposing inclusive language changes for bitbake and OE-Core has been sent
to the community for review. The aim is to implement this before M3.
*	The debian9 autobuilder issues were hardware related and fixes for
the arm systemtap issues are being tested but autobuilder intermittent
issues are still at an all time high.
*
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgNISmH0Ditf0bRtSezeR2XsgK
IiSFJKF6KJUHpnzocNGzvKZbuSDKfmV3n64BFXDRqElBSJnhHtG4/pubchart?oid=1993375488
&format=interactive> CVE metrics improved for master but work still remains
on the various stable branches which have high counts.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at record high levels and help is
very much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
