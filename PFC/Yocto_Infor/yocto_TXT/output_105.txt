Hello all,
There's an ongoing work on the YP security and we have had an
interesting discussion during the weekly meeting on September 26.
Slides used are available from the wiki [1]. If you're interested i
security subjects, please comment on the content.

Two processes are currently in the works:
- the vulnerability reporting process and the security team [2]
(complete, ready for review)
- the CVE synchronization [3] (work in progress)

They are working for your feedback!

We are also searching for people who will like to join the group
experimenting with CVE work synchronization.

Kind regards,
Marta
