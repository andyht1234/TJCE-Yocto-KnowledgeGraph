Could someone point me to a wiki on how yocto testing/QA/conformance is done?   The Distro Testing Plan<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Distro_Testing_Plan#QA_Responsible> wiki seems outdated, and my inquiry to Jose bounced.

Thanks,

George (gk4)

Jose,

I've been reading the Distro Testing Plan<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Distro_Testing_Plan#QA_Responsible>, and I tried following the instructions to git clone git.yoctoproject.org/git/yocto-autobuilder, but that repo is empty with just a README.   Per the README, when I tried to git clone yocto-autobuilder2 or yocto-autobuilder-helper then the connections timed out for each.

Can you tell me what the state of testing is for Yocto?

Thanks,

The wiki is a bit out of date, sorry. We have been working onÂ 
documenting our testing in a manual:

http://docs.yoctoproject.org/test-manual/index.html

Short summary is you can see builds here:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/

and an example release test report:

http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-3.3/testreport.txt

Cheers,

Richard
