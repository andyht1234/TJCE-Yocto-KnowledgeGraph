I ran across the following under the Yocto Project Profiling and Tracing Manual, and after checking my ipk data files/layout, I was wondering if someone could tell me, if ipk is capable of performing a similar set of operations to install my debug data ?, and if so, what would be the correct command sequence ?

" The debug packages once built can be found in build/tmp/deploy/rpm/* on the host system. Find the busybox-dbg-...rpm file and copy it to the target. For example:

[trz@empanada core2]$ scp /home/trz/yocto/crownbay-tracing-dbg/build/tmp/deploy/rpm/core2_32/busybox-dbg-1.20.2r2.core2_32.rpm root@192.168.1.31:
     root@192.168.1.31's password:
     busybox-dbg-1.20.2-r2.core2_32.rpm                     100% 1826KB   1.8MB/s   00:01

Now install the debug rpm on the target:
     root@crownbay:~# rpm -i busybox-dbg-1.20.2-r2.core2_32.rpm
"

Thanks,
Steve

Is it documented anywhere on how one might manually load debug info an for image with the binaries stripped ?

Thanks,
Steve

what you are looking for is perhaps achieved better by setting a 
feedserver on your buildmachine and then let your target download/update 
packages much like other distributions

in local.conf set

PACKAGE_FEED_URIS = "http://10.0.0.10:8000"

this would encode the feedserver address into you online package manager 
config in image

then run

bitbake package-index

which would update the feed metadata index

Run a http-server on the feed directory on buildserver

a poor man's way is

cd build/tmp/deploy/ipk/
python -m http.server

then you can go to your target and do normal opkg operations


opkg update && opkg install busybox-dbg

another advantage of this approach is that it will automatically 
download/install the dependecies.
