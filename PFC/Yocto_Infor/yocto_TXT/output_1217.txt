Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.1.1 is in QA.
*	Patches continue to flow steadily into master.
*	We are keeping roughly up to date with version upgrades, thanks to
those working on that.
*	We renamed the create-spdx class to include a version in the name as
it became clear the output is specific to that version of SPDX and will need
changes for 3.0.
*	oe-selftest is now working much better on arm hosts (thanks Ross).
*	We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.
*	We need to form a plan for handling the Y2038 issue on 32 bit
platforms. There don't appear to be easy solutions so a flag day adding to
CFLAGS looks like it may be the only realistic option.
*	It was great to see some interesting bitbake patches/fixes.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.2. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.2_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
