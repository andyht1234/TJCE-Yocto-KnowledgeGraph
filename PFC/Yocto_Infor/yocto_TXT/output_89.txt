Key Status/Updates:

   -

   YP 4.3 M4 is due to build this week. We have challenges due to the
   kernel version.
   -

   YP 3.1.28 was released.
   -

   YP 4.0.13 is due to be released
   -

   The biggest challenge for the M4 build is that the 6.4 kernel was made
   EOL. Thanks to hard work from Bruce we have 6.5 recipes but this kernel
   version is throwing multiple errors in testing:
   -

      cryptodev breaks (patch in master-next)
      -

      x86 image testing randomly fails with login issues (both selftest and
      testimage)
      -

      arm kvm ptest images randomly throw jitterentropy errors and fail
      -

      strace ptest failures (x86 and arm)
      -

      arm LTP testing fails with OOM crashes

We don’t have fixes for the OOM issue or strace at this point, potential
ideas for other issues are undergoing testing.

   -

   The numpy reproducibility issue was finally root caused and resolved.
   -

   Issues with mesa-native and contamination with llvm from the host have
   been resolved
   -

   Improvements to bitbake-getvar output and handling of undefined values
   were merged
   -

   The openssh ptest intermittent failure does have better logs available
   but we’ve yet to decode what it means:

   -

   The project is working on improving its security processes and policies,
   there are emails on the mailing list discussing this. Please highlight
   these to any parties who may be interested or have useful feedback.


Ways to contribute:

   -

   As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which
   are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to
   keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool,
   toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many
   have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
   components!
   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.

   appreciated.
