Hi,

I'm moving my layers from dunfell to kirkstone and for some recipes
I'm hitting an issue with following fetch issue:
Bitbake Fetcher Error: FetchError("Recipe uses a floating tag/branch
without a fixed SRCREV yet doesn't call bb.fetch2.get_srcrev() (use
SRCPV in PV for OE).", None)

My SRC_URI looks like this:

SRC_URI = "git://mysupersecretgitproject.git;protocol=https;branch=master;tag=v${PV}"
and PV is properly set to tag name.

By adding this to beginning of recipe it seems it start working:
python() {
        bb.warn("SRCPV:%s"%d.getVar("SRCPV"))
}

Any ideas what am I missing?

Thanks and regards,

marek
