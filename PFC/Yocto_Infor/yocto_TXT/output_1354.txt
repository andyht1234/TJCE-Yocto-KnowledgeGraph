The recently updated version of qemu (v7.1) is causing qemu-cortex-a53
tests to fail.  See
https://gitlab.com/jonmason00/meta-zephyr/-/jobs/3082086509

I was able to bisect the issue to that commit.  I'm not certain of the
cause beyond that, but other issues are being seen with the new qemu
and meta-arm.  Let me know if you want me to open a bug.

Thanks,
Jon
