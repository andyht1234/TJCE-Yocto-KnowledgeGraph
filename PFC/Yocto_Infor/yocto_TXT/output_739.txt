Hi,

I'm building a yocto for a rock-pi-e machine using kirkstone release.
Board boots fine but there is no audio card when checked with aplay
command. I've dug into kernel config and there was missing codec
driver but after adding there is still no audio. Any other ideas
before I dig into kernel hacking?

Thanks and BR,

marek
