Hello,

I am trying to generate a password for root and add a new user. Here is the code in the image recipe:

IMAGE_FEATURES:remove = "debug-tweaks"
INHERIT += "extrausers"
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS += "usermod -P root root; useradd -P 2023 crane"

When using "inherit extrausers", there is an error of "usermod command did not succeed."

When checking the parameter, the result is:
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS=" usermod -P root root; useradd -P 2023 crane; "

The image does requires a password for root, but doesn't generate anything in /etc/shadow and doesn't add new user in /etc/shadow as well.

I am wondering what might be missing. Can anyone give me any clue?

Thanks!
Crane

Hi,

the error could be related to the -P option in useradd command: the 
option, that allows to pass a cleartext password to the command, is not 
present anymore in recent useradd versions.

Instead you can use the -p option, that allows to pass an encrypted 
password.
Something like that:

EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS=" usermod -p `openssl passwd -6 root` root; useradd 
-P 2023 crane; "

Thanks Mauro for your input.

I referred two posts from Koan Software in my work. One is to use devtool to modify recipe and another one is to add system service to image. Very clearly explained. Thanks!

Good point. I tried, but in my case it looks still not generating the password and also no new user added.
And I am afraid that the $ symbol in the encrypted password string might prevent it from being applied. I tried to add \ before $ symbol. And it's also not working.

Wondering what else might be still missing.

Here is the variable value:
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS=" usermod -p 'openssl passwd -6 root' root; useradd -p 'openssl passwd -6 2023' crane; "

Actually no need to add \ before $ symbol.  \ is already added as below:
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS=" usermod -p '\$6\$9UMdfjsa9kYD4oQB\$a3jUptBObMgh8palvzovMriEp8X0d/7xHHOj7WdcBKXvhcUvOBOzFTAdl3.NDi.CGwMtpwfB3J6dvxRQN.iUq.' root; useradd -p '\$6\$IfrdWN4tMhCHSL6E\$NS3/r/qO3kSKNh0PVtqmrocLAxbdkUZu3cYg7czkMy9Y42le02G92hgxRVvsFogjCufY4BRdjRdaW77K/kT170' crane; "

oh, indeed.

Try with this:

EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS=" usermod -p '$(openssl passwd -6 root)' root; 
useradd -p '$(openssl passwd -6 2023)' crane; "

Not working.
Here is the value of the variable becoming:
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS=" usermod -p '\$(openssl passwd -6 root)' root; useradd -p '\$(openssl passwd -6 2023)' crane; "
One \ is added before $ symbol.

Uh, I'm using this one successfully, on a Yocto Warrior.

Then the \ is added automatically by Yocto? Maybe something has changed 
in variables parsing...or could be a bug? Don't know, help needed from 
the experts!

You can put the encrypted password (the result of the "openssl passwd -6 
root" command) directly in the variable, taking care to put a "\" before 
the three "$" contained in the string. Something like this:

EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS=" usermod -p 
'\$6\$CEM0hANiVS9VXN8N\$Q9XK1KTpq2faq2fNbSRLNeeA4mmQsl8g1Gwl3QnTPlRPb5ljCAa./bbhffcthXxUen4jSFL6HKGQPlHZNQkfA/' 
root; useradd -p 
'\$6\$5wVybJkbuowR0iMi\$tnEJEEbXbcRfksKRSt7rjlY1hRERrjqFOlCaa0s1ivISxAHT7MFdcnZvVbRHgkqRSYzA1oLUxtR0LuvDTMPR5/' 
crane; "

By the way, this approach has the advantage to mask the password.

Tried as well. And a \ is added automatically in front of $, so no need to add it. But still not working.
There must be something else missing. Anyway to debug in this case?

From testing I have observed that the extrausers does not work from a recipe, while useradd works correctly from a recipe.
The extrausers should work as expected from within the distribution description, so you might want to try that.

For debugging you could print the bitbake variables to screen (-e) and grep on the EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS.

Hope this is will help you solving the issue.

See this

https://github.com/YoeDistro/yoe-distro/blob/master/conf/projects/rpi4-64/config.conf#L57-L66

you might try something like that in config metadata e.g. local.conf

Hi all,

I did some tests on a Yocto Kirkstone using qemux86-64.

I can confirm that:

- using extrausers class in local.conf (as pointed out by Khem) works 
properly

   INHERIT += "extrausers"
   EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "useradd -p '$(openssl passwd -6 crane)' crane;"

   OR (escaped cyphered password)

   INHERIT += "extrausers"
   EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "useradd -p 
'\$6\$z6vHqLrwnkHbcf5n\$0Fod3ijjV0XcGLYJm.EcomRXsL63p3ntbmznEjp7FHQq4sDtd/YFcAbw5Dg4/iQAsAyee7YG5/LNTe4nCwxzg1' 
crane;"

- using extrausers class in image recipe works properly

   inherit extrausers
   EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "useradd -p '$(openssl passwd -6 crane)' crane;"

   OR (escaped cyphered password)

   inherit extrausers
   MY_PASSWORD = 
"$6$jAB6jLC45xV7v9yY$nZS7WymiLb1152aV51mYDc0RNctmYi9M0xS9bkXUCIafCGQ/EyIp76.kltVKWt5U4YjHkTOGymP7OJ6p9DVpN."
   EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "useradd -p '${MY_PASSWORD}' crane;"

- using useradd class in a recipe works

   inherit useradd
   DEPENDS += "openssl-native"
   USERADD_PARAM:${PN}-user3 = "-u 1202 -d /home/user3 -r -s /bin/sh -p 
'$(openssl passwd -6 user3)' user3"

   OR (escaped cyphered password)

   inherit useradd
   USERADD_PARAM:${PN}-user3 = "-u 1202 -d /home/user3 -r -s /bin/sh -p 
'\$6\$bblNDDxePa6LNBbE\$3P5MkG2pUFY1TI1A2Y9CXjA83gvnrO7UMQkcWOEOO7MN4ESJHG7wqfiYWOeHPGZSEKM5/3bcMHDsDBfxpZKRv1' 
user3"

The only thing to pay attention to is to add

   DEPENDS += "openssl-native"

in the recipe in case the openssl form is used.

To Crane: please try to build the image and test it, don't stop at Yocto 
variables analysis step.

Thanks Mauro so much.

Indeed, it is not relevant the value of the variable, but where it is assigned.
It doesn't work to assign these values in image recipe, but works in local.conf.

I am wondering what's the different in assigning the value in different locations. Maybe it is relevant to the building sequence. If it is assigned later, it is useless. Is there any rule to follow? Or it is just from experience?

Another question I think of is how you guys source control local.conf. It looks it might be much different from project to project.

Thanks!
Crane

extrausers class (and then EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS) works both in image 
recipe and in local.conf, both with the openssl command and with the 
ciphered password.

extrauser class is designed to add or modify users at image level, then 
it must be used in image recipes or in a .conf file. [1]

useradd class is designed to create users at package level, then it must 
be used in normal (not image) recipes only. [2]

Thanks Manro for sharing these links. Now I see a big pool of classes that can be used.

Eventually I found that why it doesn't work for me to add EXTRA_USER_PARAMS in image recipe is that I used this line: INHERIT += "extrausers"
instead of this line: inherit extrausers
to use the class extrausers.

But at the beginning there was an error when using "inherit extrauser". Now it works fine. I couldn't figure out why. But anyway it works this way now.

Regards,
Crane
