Hello,

How do you create a patch for Linux kernel configuration in a customized layer on top of an initial patch. It is a patch based on the original defconfig from vendor meta layer? I tried different ways, but none of them work.

The initial .bbappend is like this. I would like to make further changes on top of that.

SRCREV = "0086da6acd41600d47b87b05874f99704216426f"

FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"

SRC_URI += "\
file://devtool-fragment.cfg \
"

1. use devtool to modify the current kernel configuration
After using devtool menuconfig to modify the kernel configuration, the .config is updated.
But, here is a big BUT, after using devtool build to build kernel image, the kernel image is still built using the defconfig originally from the vendor meta layer meta-raspberrypi.
If using devtool update-recipe to create a patch any way, then do devtool reset and use bitbake to build the kernel image, the result is the same (the kernel image uses original defconfig).

2. use git format-patch to create a patch file and then add the patch file into .bbappend.
Say, a patch 0001-update-kernel-config-to-enable-uart-console.patch is added into files folder.
Then add one line in .bbappend file like this:
SRCREV = "0086da6acd41600d47b87b05874f99704216426f"

FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"

SRC_URI += "\
file://devtool-fragment.cfg \
file://0001-update-kernel-config-to-enable-uart-console.patch \
"
But this way, the patch couldn't be applied at all. An error is caused.

3. Tried to use git to create a patch in different folder
Most of tries got the same result.
One of them seems applied. But from the result, it is actually not applied.

So, which way should work? Anything missing in what I did.

Thanks for your help!

Crane

Finally found two ways to do this and worked in my case:
1. use bitbake -c diffconfig to create a fragment config and then add the fragment config to a .bbappend
2. add an out-of-tree defconfig in .bb
The documentation says out-of-tree defconfig takes precedence. But in my case KBUILD_DEFCONFIG is used and the out-of-tree defconfig is dropped.
No idea why. I have to use KBUILD_DEFCONFIG:remove to clear it.

You could try using SCC like linux-yocto recipe does it here.
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/plain/meta/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_6.1.bb

I have use this in the past to override bsp layer config and also add
patches in my own derived bsp layer.
