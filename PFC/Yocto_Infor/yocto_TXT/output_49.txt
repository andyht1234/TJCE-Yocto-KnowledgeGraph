Dear All，


    Yocto is a very good project to manage projects in a modular, layered and overlay way. 
It's easy to bring Yocto into embedded projects and manage different projects. 
    However, with more and more modules added to their embedded projects, more and more hardware 
platforms are supported, more and more customers are facing, and the needs of customization are varied. 
Too much dispersion of configuration has also become a headache for project engineers.


yocto version: 2.7 (warrior)


     1. How can I customize a configuration file for a specific layer or an entire project? 
        This configuration file defines a number of variables, which are used by different bb or bbappend files in the change or throughout the project.
         It is required that when a variable in the file changes, the bb using that variable can be recompiled.


     2. I added a file under conf, named value.inc, a.bb and b.bb both configuration files contain this configuration file (such as: require path/conf/value.inc), 
         and then both bb files get the value of a variable, and then modify the compilation parameters according to the value of this variable. 
        (such as:EXTRA_OECMAKE += "${@bb.utils.contains('CPU_COUNT', '1', '-DSENSOR_CPUM_ENABLE=ON', '-DSENSOR_CPUM_ENABLE=OFF', d)}" )
        Finally, modify the value of the variable CPU_COUNT(change the value to "0" or to "1") in value.inc to recompile the entire project. 
        It was found that this variable was modified 10 times and recompiled 10 times, of which 4 times the two related packages were not recompiled. 
        Why is that? How to solve this problem?


    3. Modify the detection rules of the BB file. (set BB_HASHCHECK_FUNCTION= “1” in local.conf, and set BB_HASHBASE_WHITELIST = "path/conf/value.inc" in layer.conf)
        Other modifications and testing procedures are consistent with point 2.
        It turned out that after re-modifying and compiling 10 times, the two BB packages were still not compiled several times.
        Why is that? How to solve this problem?
       Is it the wrong way to use it? What does the right approach look like?


    4. Is there any good way to solve the problem mentioned at the beginning? Or where to start solving this problem?


I look forward to hearing from you.
Byron Wang
