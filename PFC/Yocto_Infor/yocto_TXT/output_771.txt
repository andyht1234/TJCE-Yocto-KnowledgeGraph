Hi,
Iam working on a dunfell version and using a custom u-boot, kernel etc.
I need to add u-boot-fw-utils to my image and its well documented that the
recipe is obsolete and is replaced by the libubootenv.
But i'm not sure how to add libubootenv to the rootfs.
I tried adding
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_u-boot-fw-utils = “libubootenv”
to the local.conf, but no luck .
Can anyone tell the procedure for getting u-boot-fw-utils in my rootfs

Thankyou

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " libubootenv-bin"

And probably you have to add u-boot-env as well to install fw_env.config.

Best regards,
