Key Status/Updates:

   -

   The YP 4.3 (M4) rc1 build is still pending
   -

   For the 4.3 release, the 6.5 serial port issues are still presenting a
   challenge. We have merged a workaround which seems to fix things for the
   majority of cases. There is also a second proposed patch from upstream
   which may help. The dilemma is which option to go for in the release and
   the time implications of the choice as one is tested and one is not.
   -

   The only other potential issue for 4.3 is the strace ptest image space
   issues which is still being worked on.
   -

   Patchtest did merge to OE-Core and will be included in the release
   allowing users to locally test their patches before submission using the
   same code/tests we will ultimately run against mailing list submissions.
   This is late in the cycle but important to help users and standalone code
   so worthwhile adding since it was ready. Thanks Trevor!
   -

   There were multiple CVE fixes merged over the last week to ensure the
   release had recent widely publicized CVEs addressed.
   -

   Toaster has had upgrades to key components which help address security
   issues and patches are merging to enable testing to be resumed and
   ultimately, automated.
   -

   There was a big improvement in reproducibility for rust. Unfortunately
   this hasn’t addressed all the issues but is a big step forward and great to
   see progress on what was a really difficult to track down issue, thanks
   Sundeep.
   -

   The project is pleased to have a new content delivery network (CDN)
   available to share sstate from the autobuilder with. See the entry in
   local.conf.sample on how to use it.
   -

   After consultation and discussions the project is now about to document
   its security processes to complete the work in this area. Please watch the
   mailing lists such as the architecture list if you have an interest in this
   area.


Ways to contribute:

   -

   As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which
   are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to
   keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool,
   toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many
   have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
   components!
   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
