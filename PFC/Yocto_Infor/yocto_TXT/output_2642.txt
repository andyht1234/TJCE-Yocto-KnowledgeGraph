Hello Steve,

I have been running the PREEMPT_RT for Intel platforms for a few
releases, I remember it fetched sources from a GIT branch for -rt
(PREEMPT_RT). So it does not need to apply separate patches in that
case.

Could you check if this is the case for you as well?

Regards,

Leon.

p.s. Slightly off-topic, I moved away from PREEMPT_RT in favor of task
isolation mode, where we use one CPU core in isolated single task
mode, for *much* lower latencies than PREEMPT_RT can provide.

I will check...

Would you have an example of a recipe that shows how to apply the rt path ?

Thanks,
Steve
