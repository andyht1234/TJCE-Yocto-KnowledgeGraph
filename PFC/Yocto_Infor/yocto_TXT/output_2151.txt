I ran into a problem with a custom image type class. I called the class 
image_types_ota.bbclass.

When I try to use it I am getting these error messages for two 
predefined image recipes (but only for these two, for any other image 
recipe it is fine):

ERROR: 
/develop/projects/tcu/build/../poky/meta/recipes-rt/images/core-image-rt-sdk.bb: 
No IMAGE_CMD defined for IMAGE_FSTYPES entry 'ota' - possibly invalid 
type name or missing support class
ERROR: 
/develop/projects/tcu/build/../meta-openembedded/meta-networking/recipes-core/images/meta-networking-image-base.bb: 
No IMAGE_CMD defined for IMAGE_FSTYPES entry 'ota' - possibly invalid 
type name or missing support class
ERROR: Failed to parse recipe: 
/develop/projects/tcu/build/../poky/meta/recipes-rt/images/core-image-rt-sdk.bb

I have no idea what in these two image recipes could trigger this error 
message.

Thanks,
Rudi

hard to tell without knowing how ota class is being plugged in or what
its content is.
Do you define IMAGE_FSTYPES:ota ... somewhere ?

The image class defines IMAGE_CMD. There is not much to it for now:

OTA_ROOTFS_MD5 ?= "rootfs.md5"

IMAGE_CMD:ota () {
     build_ota="${WORKDIR}/build-ota"

     # rootfs
     md5sum ${IMAGE_ROOTFS} > ${build_ota}/OTA_ROOTFS_MD5
}

What I don't see is why these two are the only image recipes this is 
occurring with. All the other image recipes do not throw a parser error.
