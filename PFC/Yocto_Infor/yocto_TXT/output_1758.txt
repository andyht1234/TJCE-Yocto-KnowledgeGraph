I was able to work this one out. It was a zero length bb_unihashes.dat
file being placed in the eSDK, probably from a race on bitbake's cache
files. I have an idea of what is happening and some patches which
should fix it but they need testing. The bug has been there since at
least dunfell so I don't think it should block release, it is very
rare.

Cheers,

Richard
