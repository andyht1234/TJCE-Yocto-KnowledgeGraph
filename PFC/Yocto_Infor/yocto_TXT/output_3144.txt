Hi,

I was having a bbappend for uboot v2021.04 that calls binman command from u-boot source tree but it doesn't seems to work with bitbake with an error of unknown location of libfdt.
I have added dependency to dtc-native or did I missed anything? Is there any plan to enable binman support within u-boot-tools recipe?

Off-hand, I suspect it might be a little tricky to use binman outside of
the U-Boot context directly.  Simon, any thoughts?

Thanks for the pointer. I realized the dtc was compiled with NO_PYTHON=1 flag. Will start work from that path.

Regards,
Rebecca
