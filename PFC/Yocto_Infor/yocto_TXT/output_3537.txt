Hi everyone,

I'm making an image that includes the node-red recipe from meta-iot-cloud.
The whole process takes about 30+ minutes for that recipe alone (most of the time spent in do_configure).
Now I want to override the recipe systemd service file and create a nodered user. Every time I change my bbappend file I have to wait 30+ minutes to have the result even for a small systemd file change.

Is it possible to speed up the process somehow?

Thanks in advance

I never worked with node-red in yocto, so I can't speak specifically
for that, but I encountered similar situations before. Here is what I
usually do when I need to change a file in a recipe that takes a really
long time to compile or triggers a rebuild of a ton of other recipes.

This only works for files that don't need to be compiled,Â like
configuration files, systemd service files, udev rules etc. I usually
replace the file in the rootfs directly on the device (or boot from NFS
and edit the file in the NFS export). For example if I need to change a
systemd service file, I change the file on my host, copy it with scp to
the device and check if everything is working as expected. When I'm
finished, I reintegrate my edits with a bbappend file and check again
if it works.

Hi Nicolas,

Thank you for the advice, that would work for files outside the npm
packages!

Hopefully there's a way to improve npm install speed too, I was hoping
there was a way to just run npm install instead of going through the yocto
npm process (which takes 30 mins vs < 1 min that npm takesi
