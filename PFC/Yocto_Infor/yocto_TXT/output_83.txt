So I hav a custom recipe, gpsd is in place and functioning along with cgps, I can see the position nicely.

I have also added per instructions I found the whole list of programs related to gps utils...
SUMMARY_gps-utils = "Utils used for simulating, monitoring,... a GPS"
# Python files are required for gps/fake, required for gpsfake.
FILES_gps-utils = "${bindir}/* ${libdir}/gps/*.py ${libdir}/gps/*.so"
FILES_gps-utils += "${bindir}/cgps ${bindir}/gegps ${bindir}/gps2udp"
FILES_gps-utils += "${bindir}/gpscat ${bindir}/gpscsv ${bindir}/gpsctl"
FILES_gps-utils += "${bindir}/gpsdebuginfo ${bindir}/gpsdecode ${bindir}/gpsfake"
FILES_gps-utils += "${bindir}/gpsmon ${bindir}/gpspipe ${bindir}/gpsplot"
FILES_gps-utils += "${bindir}/gpsprof ${bindir}/gpsrinex ${bindir}/gpssnmp"
FILES_gps-utils += "${bindir}/gpssubframe ${bindir}/gpxlogger ${bindir}/lcdgps "
FILES_gps-utils += "${bindir}/ntpshmmon ${bindir}/ppscheck ${bindir}/ubxtool"
FILES_gps-utils += "${bindir}/xgps ${bindir}/xgpsspeed ${bindir}/zerk"

this appears to build without complaining but when I login to the image most of those tools (including the ubxtool) appear to be missing - though cgps works as it did BEFORE I added all that list of extra tools. ubxtool doesnt appear in the files-in-image.txt which suggests I am not so boneheaded as to not be using a right path (I am a bone head in many respects :) ). gps-utils appeas in the installed-packages-names.txt which again isnt surprising as cgps is working (installed packages lists gps-utils_3.20-r0_cortexa53-crypto.ipk).

I am making progress with understanding yocto building but this is beyond my ken. I guess the files gps utils above doesnt do anything OR is done too late to make a difference but there was no complaint that I could see (unless someone can point me at the right file to check)

Any hints? Seems others have had some issues which is where I got the above stuff from and others claim ubxtool is built but then for some reason not included (seems an odd thing)

I suggest to enable "buildhistory" feature. It will export all source recipe (source package)
and binary package metadata as a git repository to build/buildhistory. There you can
quite easily "git grep" for files inside binary packages and things like source recipe
and binary package dependencies (DEPENDS and RDEPENDS). This can be enabled with local.conf
line:

INHERIT += "buildhistory"

Then when you modify things, it's a good idea to check "bitbake -e recipe" output before and after
your changes to a recipe, be it a .bbappend or changes to the recipe proper. bitbake
will by design not warn about typos etc. After modifying contents of recipes to include new files
in the binary package, you can then check buildhistory data as well to see that the files added
are now in some of the binary packages.

yocto is a tool for building custom linux distributions and is by definition tricky
to understand. Any linux distro has areas which are tricky and hard grasp. 
yocto build tool bitbake builds recipes just like Debian/Ubuntu etc build source packages
and that generate binary packages. In yocto image recipes then include a specific
set of binary packages and their dependencies. What gets installed to images is controlled
by the few variables in image recipes which include names of binary packages (tip of dependency trees)),
and the runtime RDEPENDS of those binary packages and everything which they RDEPEND on.

Documentation may help too:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#customizing-images

Hope this helps,

-Mikko
