hello everybody,
i want to compile kernel with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`
it has errors:
```
| linker.c:17:10: fatal error: libelf.h: No such file or directory
|    17 | #include <libelf.h>
|       |          ^~~~~~~~~~
| compilation terminated.
| btf.c:18:10: fatal error: gelf.h: No such file or directory
|    18 | #include <gelf.h>
|       |          ^~~~~~~~
```

i also added to linux_%.bbappend:
```
DEPENDS = "elfutils elfutils-native"
```

how can i solve this problem?
thanks

check where they exist on recipe sysroots. Secondly its not clear if this
is building a host tool here or a target piece. ideally show the failing full
compiler cmdline and it might show the problem in better light e.g. missing
include paths etc.

I can at least confirm that linux-yocto builds with that option
enabled. It has similar dependencies in the recipes for elfutils.

What's your kernel provider ?
