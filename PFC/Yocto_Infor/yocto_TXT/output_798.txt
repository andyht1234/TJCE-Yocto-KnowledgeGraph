Hi guys,
I am new to yocto needed your help.
I have an executable binary file that is probably compiled using the gcc
compiler. I am using yocto dunfell for my project my build_sys is
"x86_64-linux" , my target_sys is "aarch64-poky-linux".

Can you please guide me as to what I need to load this binary executable
file is my generated image file.

Thanks and Regards,
Hassan

Is this binary statically linked? Otherwise, you have no guarantee that 
it will run on your root filesystem.

If so, you could write a recipe to integrate the binary into your root 
filesystem, as it's possible to do with pre-compiled libraries : 
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/common-tasks.html#working-with-pre-built-libraries. 
Caution, in this document, the new override syntax (with ":" instead of 
"_") is shown, it doesn't apply to Dunfell.

I hope this helps
Cheers
Michael.

It is statically linked file written using c language.

Will it be okay for me to refer the above link for my specific case?

I'd say yes, write a similar recipe for your binary.

Its a .exe binary file. Will it work?

Not if that's a Windows executable (you can check with the "file" 
command). Just try to run it on your target system a

Sorry, Ive made some errors here. I just run file command to check, and it seems I was misled by my team into believing it was a statically linked binary.
Ive attached a screenshot for your reference about the type of file it is.
Maybe that would help clear out the mess Ive made.

Thanks and regards,
Hassan

Can you help me to compile for dynamically linked executable file in yocto
dunfell?
Thanks

For a dynamically linked executable you should definitely build it from 
source.
There is no shortcut here. You should take the time to read the Yocto 
manual to know how to do it: https://docs.yoctoproject.org/
Cheers
Michael.
