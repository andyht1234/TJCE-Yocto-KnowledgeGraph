Unrelated to this patch set, KERNEL_IMAGETYPE actually defaults to 
zImage so we could just avoid doing it again in rk3066, rk3188, rk3328.

Also, for newer versions of patch series, please use:
git format-patch -v3
or
git send-email -v3

and it should create a mail with:
[PATCH v3] in there
because with the current subject being
Allow KERNEL_IMAGETYPE override v3
this would be the commit title inside the git repo and this is the kind 
of information we don't necessarily need in the git repo :) (but thanks 
for thinknig about adding it, it makes it easier to follow which patch 
mail is the latest version :) ).

Cheers,
Quentin

Would "git send-email -v3" also add the "meta-rockchip"?
I usually just do:

	$ git format-patch --subject-prefix="meta-rockchip][PATCH v3" ...
	$ git send-email <patch>

I'll fix the commit messages up so don't worry about sending a v4. Thanks for
your patches! It's nice to not be the only one thinking about this layer.

Best regards,
	Trevor

I assume anything you can pass to git-format-patch can be passed to 
git-send-email, so git send-email --subject-prefix="meta-rockchip][PATCH 
v3" probably would work just as fine? However these parameters only work 
if you pass a gitrev and not a patch

c.f. https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email#_description
"""
Patches can be specified as files, directories (which will send all 
files in the directory), or directly as a revision list. In the last 
case, any format accepted by git-format-patch[1] can be passed to git 
send-email, as well as options understood by git-format-patch[1].
"""

Cheers,
Quentin
