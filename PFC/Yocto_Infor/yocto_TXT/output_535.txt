Hello geeks

Hope all are well

I need to create the Yocto recipe to extract the local tra.gz based project files in to root directory

here is my recipe contents

###############################################################

SUMMARY = "Eyesite Application"
LICENSE = "MIT"

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/files:"

LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"

FILES_${PN} += "/eyesite"

SRC_URI = "file://eyesite.tar.gz"

S = "${WORKDIR}"

do_unpack() {
# Extract the tar.gz file
tar -xf ${WORKDIR}/eyesite.tar.gz -C ${WORKDIR}
}

do_install() {
# Create the eyesite directory in the root
install -d ${D}/eyesite

# Install the extracted application
cp -r ${WORKDIR}/eyesite ${D}/eyesite
}

#################################################################

The file structure is as follows under the *recipe-app* file

├── eyesite
│   ├── eyesite_1.0.bb
│   └── files
│       └── eyesite.tar.gz

I'm getting below Yocto error during the building
########################################################

Log data follows:
| DEBUG: Executing shell function do_unpack
| tar: /home/mahi/Documents/AIO_System/var-fslc-yocto/build_aio/tmp/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-fslc-linux-gnueabi/eyesite/1.0-r0/eyesite.tar.gz: Cannot open: No such file or directory

########################################################

This is only needed in bbappends.

Ideally this points at a license statement inside your tarballs.

Why are you manually unpacking the tarball? Delete this and let the default unpack handle this, setting S as appropriate depending on the content of the tarball.
