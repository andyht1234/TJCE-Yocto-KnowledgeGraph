Can the build system be extended to generate two WIC files for on run,
is that possible?

I need the same rootfs once with a boot partition

part /boot
part /

and one image only with rootfs

part /

so I can write sdcards with same rootfs for older systems expecting root
on mmcblk0p1 (BBB debian based) and newer ones expecting it on mmcblk0p2
(BBB yocto based).

Is that possible, how could one approach such a config?

Kind Regards
Konstantin

The easiest is probably to make two image recipes pointing to
different wic files, but sharing everything else via .inc.

You mean moving my current meta-insidem2m/recipes-core/images/sdcard.bb
to something like meta-insidem2m/recipes-core/images/sdcard_base.bb,
creating two new ones like sdcard_d.bb and sdcard_y.bb among the
sdcard_base.bb, require the sdcard_base.bb from sdcard_d.bb and sdcard_y.bb
and having the latter files overwrite the variable WKS_FILE with
different ones?

According to preliminary tests the search path for wks files also
include meta-insidem2m/recipes-core/images where the sdcard*.bb are
located and could ne put right there.

This way? I will test, that sounds convenient.

Kind Regards
Konstantin

sdcard-base.inc is better, because sdcard-base.bb is a recipe in
itself, but you don't want to build that (or others to get confused
about its purpose).

Meanwhile I tested my proposed approach and it works well...

... but this is a nice hint! Thank you very much!

I was bothered colleagues trying to build the base
"image" indeed :-)
