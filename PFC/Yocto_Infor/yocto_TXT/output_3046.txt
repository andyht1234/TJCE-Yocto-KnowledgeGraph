Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.3.2 was released
*	YP 3.1.10 is due to be released imminently
*	OE-Core has moved to the new override syntax and is now only
compatible with the honister release series. Other layers will need to
migrate to the new syntax to work with it. There is documentation about
handling migration to the new syntax in the migration section of the manual:

 
<http://docs.yoctoproject.org/migration-guides/migration-3.4.html#override-s
yntax-changes>
http://docs.yoctoproject.org/migration-guides/migration-3.4.html#override-sy
ntax-changes

*	There has been at least one important bug fix to the overrides
syntax change in OE-Core but in general layers do seem to be migrating over
and there has been a lot of positive feedback about making this change from
a readability perspective. Some additional variables were converted for
consistency too.
*	In the last week long standing bugs were fixed, such as being able
to use the devupstream class with natively extended recipes, some bitbake
hangs in unusual situations with cleanups to the error paths around this and
improvements to LTO with regard to binary reproducibility. 
*	The prserv rewrite is making progress but still has some issues with
python asyncio.
*	Intermittent issues are ongoing, particularly ptest ones. Help is
very much welcome on these issues. You can see the list of failures we're
continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT
*	The multiconfig changes pending in master-next for a long time were
merged as the approach used is better overall. If anyone still sees
multiconfig scheduling bugs, please report those.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
