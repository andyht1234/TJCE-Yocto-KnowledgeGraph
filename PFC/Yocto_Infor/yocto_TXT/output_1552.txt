Hi,

I added the following to our image recipe:
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " nftables"

When running that image, nftables seems to be included, but we get the
following error:
~# nft
../../nftables-0.7/src/netlink.c:59: Unable to initialize Netlink socket:
Protocol not supported

Furthermore, it's not showing in lsmod, and also not in modprobe
--showconfigs.

This is the active kernel config:

What am I missing? Should I enable it some other way instead of using

Thanks,

It seems you built many netfilter features/drivers as modules and not 
built-in in the kernel. When that is the case, you need to add the 
modules to your image because Yocto does not do it for you. Yocto splits 
each module in its own package. As a simple try, you can add the 
kernel-modules package to your image, it is a package that pulls all 
kernel module packages all at once. At least you'll know if there's 
another issue before pinpointing the exact kernel module package names 
you will want in your image (kernel-modules can be pretty big if you 
don't have a "clean" defconfig with many unnecessary drivers built as 
modules).

Cheers,
Quentin

Hi Quentin,

Thank you for your response!

I added kernel-modules to the IMAGE_INSTALL_append, but it seems that the
modules are still not being loaded.
Is that the correct way?

Also I see that CONFIG_NF_TABLES is not set (with ~# zcat /proc/config.gz |
grep CONFIG_NF_ | grep TABLE)
Is that expected?

Kind regards,

Maik Vermeulen

No, you would indeed need to enable those in your kernel config.

Cheers,

0.7 - that's pre-dunfell!

For master or kirkstone, see:
https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/linux-yocto/message/11523?p=%2C%2C%2C20%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A%3Acreated%2C0%2Cmacleod%2C20%2C1%2C0%2C92659340

and the follow-up that I'll send soon to get the pass-rate to 100%.

You won't be able to use the WR Linux features directly but take a look 
at the image.inc
and template.conf files in:

https://github.com/WindRiver-Labs/wrlinux/tree/WRLINUX_10_21_BASE/templates/feature/nftables

for the syntax to use the kernel scc files for nftables. It may not be 
there if you're using an older kernel.
