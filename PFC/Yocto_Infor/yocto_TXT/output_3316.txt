Key Status/Updates:

*	3.4, M1 is due to build this week (but see below).
*	YP 3.1.8 was released.
*	A possible cause for some of the intermittent issues we've been
seeing has been identified as some of the kernel patches in linux-yocto,
particularly aufs. We're investigating this and will likely hold M1 until it
is resolved.
*	A second intermittent issue has appeared with the latest kernel
upgrade on centos8 causing testsdk to fail. This will also likely block M1
as builds fail with the issue and we'd have to disable autobuilder workers
to make a release build.
*	We have a 10th anniversary T-shirt and some other Yocto Project
items (hoody, stickers, mugs etc.) now available at
<https://yoctoproject.org/shop> https://yoctoproject.org/shop (EU and
Americas sources)
*	The multiconfig changes in bitbake continue to cause problems, we
still need simpler test cases to reproduce issues rather than huge builds.
The existing patches seem to fix some workloads and break others. Richard is
trying to fix but trying to fix autobuilder issues and other problems and
these are slow builds to debug.
*	Intermittent autobuilder issues continue to occur and continue to be
at record high levels. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We are working to identify the load pattern on the infrastructure that seems
to trigger these.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
