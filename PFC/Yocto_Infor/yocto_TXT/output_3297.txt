I was able to reproduce the error even with plain poky (without kas):

```bash
git clone -b dunfell https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky
cd poky
source oe-init-build-env
bitbake -c populate_sdk_ext core-image-minimal
```

After successful build, copy the `build/tmp/deploy/sdk/poky....sh` to
another machine (with different OS) and run it there.

I tried several different installation machines and they fail
consistently to install the extensible SDK if they run a different OS
than the build machine (e.g. Debian 10 vs. Ubuntu 18.04 vs. 20.04). See
the exakt error and complete log output in my previous message.

What is happening here? Did I use the extensible SDK wrongly? Is it
expected to be incompatible?

Thanks in advance!

Hendrik

I think it may be this bug:

https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14428

We don't have a fix as yet, it looks difficult to solve :(

Cheers,

Richard

Not a fix, but a workaround, if you are willing to use containers is to 
create a build container and a similar sdk container.

I added more information to the bug above.

Regards,

Robert
