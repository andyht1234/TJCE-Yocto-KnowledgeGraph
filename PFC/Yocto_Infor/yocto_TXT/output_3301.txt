Not sure who to ask about this.
Using https://push.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/recipes-extended/lighttpd/lighttpd_1.4.59.bb to build lighttpd, bitbake fails, and I receive tons of messages that look like:

ERROR: lighttpd-1.4.59-r0 do_package_qa: QA Issue: /usr/lib/mod_staticfile.so contained in package lighttpd-module-staticfile requires libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.4), but no providers found in RDEPENDS_lighttpd-module-staticfile? [file-rdeps]


Can someone point me in the right direction to resolve this?

-Bill

Hi Cris,

It's been a while is this still a problem for you?
If not, how did you fix it?


Can you reproduce the error with poky? git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky

What release/commit are you using?

Does it happen when you just run: bitbake lighttpd ?

Does it happen if you mv your sstate-cache (tmp*) directories aside
and do a rebuild?

What's in your local.conf?

For completeness, what is your build host distro (I doubt it matters here.).


I built poky from:
7f3c996d30 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) lttng-tools: 
upgrade 2.12.3 -> 2.12.4

on an Ubu-18.04.3 builder, and both:
$ bitbake lighttpd and
$ bitbake core-image-minimal

worked fine with:

grep -v "^$" conf/local.conf  | grep -v "^#"
MACHINE ??= "qemux86-64"
DISTRO ?= "poky"
PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES ?= "debug-tweaks"
USER_CLASSES ?= "buildstats image-prelink"
PATCHRESOLVE = "noop"
BB_DISKMON_DIRS ??= "\
     STOPTASKS,${TMPDIR},1G,100K \
     STOPTASKS,${DL_DIR},1G,100K \
     STOPTASKS,${SSTATE_DIR},1G,100K \
     STOPTASKS,/tmp,100M,100K \
     ABORT,${TMPDIR},100M,1K \
     ABORT,${DL_DIR},100M,1K \
     ABORT,${SSTATE_DIR},100M,1K \
     ABORT,/tmp,10M,1K"
PACKAGECONFIG_append_pn-qemu-system-native = " sdl"
CONF_VERSION = "1"
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = "lighttpd"

Lots of people use 20.04 so it seems odd that you'd have a problem 
specific to that host.

Okay, please encourage them to reply on this thread.

We may not always respond right away but there is usually
someone reading things and in my case, I'll respond eventually.

Thanks,
