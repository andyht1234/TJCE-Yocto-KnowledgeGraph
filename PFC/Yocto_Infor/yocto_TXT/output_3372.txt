Hi everyone.

I am trying to setup a Package Feed with signed ipk packages. For this, I first set up the key pair on my build host.

This is the result of "$ gpg --list-keys" :

/home/<username>/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
--------------------------------
pub   rsa3072 2021-05-26 [SC] [expires: 2023-05-26]
<40-char-hex-key-id>
uid           [ultimate] <user-id> <email-id>
sub   rsa3072 2021-05-26 [E] [expires: 2023-05-26]

I added the following to my local.conf :

# For generating signed packages
INHERIT += "sign_ipk"
IPK_GPG_NAME = "<last-8-digits-of-key-id>"
IPK_GPG_PASSPHRASE_FILE = "/home/<username>/passphrase.txt"
INHERIT += "sign_package_feed"
PACKAGE_FEED_GPG_NAME = "<last-8-digits-of-key-id>"
PACKAGE_FEED_GPG_PASSPHRASE_FILE = "/home/<username>/passphrase.txt"

Burnt the new image onto the SD Card and booted up. At this point, $ opkg update fails with the following error:

Collected errors:
* opkg_verify_gpg_signature: GPG signature checking not supported
* pkg_src_verify: Signature verification failed for all.
* opkg_verify_gpg_signature: GPG signature checking not supported
* pkg_src_verify: Signature verification failed for cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4.
* opkg_verify_gpg_signature: GPG signature checking not supported
* pkg_src_verify: Signature verification failed for raspberrypi3.

The /etc/pki/packagefeed-gpg directory has PACKAGEFEED-GPG-KEY-b2qt-dunfell in it.

At first gnupg wasn't installed on the target, so I added it.

Running "$ gpg --list-keys" outputs:

gpg: directory '/home/root/.gnupg' created
gpg: keybox '/home/root/.gnupg/pubring.kbx' created
gpg: /home/root/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created

I imported /etc/pki/packagefeed-gpg/PACKAGEFEED-GPG-KEY-b2qt-dunfell, after which "$ gpg --list-keys" shows the public key. But it doesn't solve the issue.
Found a question in the mailing list, where the OP used OPKG_KEYRING_KEYS. So I rebuilt the image with OPKG_KEYRING_KEYS = "<last-8-digits-of-key-id>", but the result was same as earlier.

If signature verification is disabled then the sources are updated without any error.

Thanks for reading.
