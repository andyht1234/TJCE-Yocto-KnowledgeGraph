*Hello Guys*
*I want to build "docker/buildx" from github source :- https://github.com/docker/buildx.git

procedure which i am following:-*

*1. $ git clone https://github.com/docker/buildx.git && cd buildx
2. $  make install*

*after this step I am facing an issue:-*
**
*docker: 'buildx' is not a docker command.*
*See 'docker --help'*
*which: no buildx in (/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin)*
*Makefile:8: *** recipe commences before first target.  Stop.*

*
if something is missing, please update me so that i can modify.*

*T&R*
*lavkhush*
