Dear all,

I'm really happy about the announce of the upcoming Dev Day in Prague: 
after (too many) years of virtual-only edition, I'm glad I'll travel 
again across Europe to meet again this wonderful group (I've already 
book my seat ;-) )

Unfortunately, I have a couple colleague of mine that will not be able 
to travel to Prague (they are already planning to attend to EOSS online) 
and I'm wondering if you're thinking about having also a live stream or, 
at least, if you are planning to record the sessions

Kind Regards and see you soon,
