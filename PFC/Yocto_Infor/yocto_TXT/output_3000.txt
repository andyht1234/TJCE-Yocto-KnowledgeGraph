Hello,

I have a problem importing python RPi.GPIO in yocto, not found, while they should be there only by cloning the meta-raspberry right?
Any answer please on how to get them?
thank you

There is a recipe for RPi.GPIO available in meta-raspberrypi [1]. I
doubt that it's installed in any of the default images. You should add
it to your image by appending to the IMAGE_INSTALL variable. See the
Customizing Images section in the manual [2] for more information.
