psplash doesn't work on my system because systemd attempts to start it 
at 1.6 seconds into boot, while the fb device is created 1.9 seconds 
after booting.

This results in:

[FAILED] Failed to start Start psplash boot splash screen.


I figure I'm not the first and only person in the world to encounter 
this issue...


I'm digging into udev and systemd options to properly make it wait. As 
suggested on the net, it should be possible using an udev rule like:

SUBSYSTEM=="graphics", KERNEL=="fb0", TAG+="systemd"


And then add the following to psplash-start.service:

After=dev-fb0.device

I also tried this variant, as reported by systemctl list-units:

After=sys-devices-platform-gpu-graphics-fb0.device


However, neither has any effect whatsoever, the service still tries to 
start too early and fails. The "After=" apparently is ignored or so?

Ah, just writing to the list appeared to have helped. For the dependency 
to work, you need both a "Requires" and an "After" directive, i.e.

[unit]
...
Requires=sys-devices-platform-gpu-graphics-fb0.device
After=sys-devices-platform-gpu-graphics-fb0.device

And with that change, it works. The splash appears as soon as the device 
registers.
