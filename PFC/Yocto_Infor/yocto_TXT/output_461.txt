Hi All,

The project has some exciting plans in progress and I'm happy to say
we're now in the fortunate position that we're able to seek quotations
for some development work.Â For more details please see this page on
website:

https://www.yoctoproject.org/community/yocto-project-engineering-request-for-quotation/

Please feel free to reach out to me or the Yocto Project TSC if there
are any questions.

Regards,

Richard
