Hello to Yocto community,

As I am much more passive yocto wise these few years ( working on
Android build systems and around, this is also a nightmare, I should
say ;-) ), I have one Yocto question which I never really understood.

I will ask it by example. I have one layer for the CAN tools and apps
which I have created 4 years ago:
https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/meta-socketcan

In there, in conf/layer.conf:
https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/meta-socketcan/blob/master/conf/layer.conf

I have the following line (layers' compatibility):
LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_meta-socketcan = "sumo thud warrior zeus dunfell
gatesgarth hardknott honister kirkstone"

I do not understand why we need to explicitly name releases for such
simple generic layers?!

Instead, for a virtual example:
LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_meta-socketcan = "${AUTOLAYER x}"

So all the layers might be included (or for at least lets say x = 4
latest releases, where x = 0 would be include all)? I do understand
that complex layers could NOT have such a definition (because of the
dependencies), but for the generic layers (as such presented), this
would be beneficial.

Thank you for the answers,
Zee

To me this indicates that the maintainer of the layer has tested the
compatibility of his layer with all of these releases of the Yocto Project.

A maintainer of a layer should make a deliberate decision of adding a
release or dropping one from the compatibility list. It should be an
attestation that the layer's compatibility with the releases in the list is
actually maintained and tested.

There have been changes to the syntax to conditional variables. Your layer
might well be compatible with all of the releases and it's great if you
tested it. But it's not a given.

I never cared for ${AUTOREV}, which is similar, in the first place for the
very reason that it creates inconsistent behavior. This would do the same
thing. What would the last 4 releases even mean? What is the reference and
where is it obtained from?

Agreed with Rudolf.

If the layer maintainer didn't bother to do at least do one build with new
release and adjust LAYERSERIES_COMPAT, then I don't consider that layer
well maintained (it could be someone else who uses the layer, tests it with
new release and sends PR to adjust LAYERSERIES_COMPAT).

Recently I've also seen this:
LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_phytec = "${LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_core}"

which is also bad as it completely disables the check (seen in
https://git.phytec.de/meta-phytec/tree/conf/layer.conf#n14).

And this is the commit that did this:
https://git.phytec.de/meta-phytec/commit/conf/layer.conf?id=8261e896d2b43211e7377feb38e919336d47c39f

Shame on you, phytec. Shame on you. What you do in your layers perhaps
doesn't matter so much, but you also give everyone a bad example to
follow.

That commit really is not in the spirit of things and I'm not happy
people are doing that. I'd not be surprised if that stopped working
soon.

We had a huge problem with unmaintained layers where it was unclear
which releases a master branch worked or had been tested with. An
actively maintained layer should have no problem with updating this a
couple of times a year. If that is an issue, it isn't actively
maintained and it makes that clear.

Cheers,

Richard

The compatibility is because over time things change: override syntax has changed, classes get added or removed, functionality may appear in bitbake.  Sometimes the breakage is subtle, and a layer may parse and appear to build fine, but be broken.

Your meta-socketcan layer is broken in honister onwards despite claiming compatibility, for example.

And here is another example why nobody should be using meta-socketcan:
https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/meta-socketcan/commit/cefd86cd1def9ad2e63be527f8ce36a076d7e17c#

You cannot change the declared LICENSE of the components, just because you
wish them to use the same license as the layer metadata, especially when
those components clearly declare different LICENSE in the source code, e.g.:
https://github.com/linux-can/socketcand/commit/a7ab9878d11ac187b92dcf48b6331c228f4f4b92

Using COMMON_LICENSE_DIR in LIC_FILES_CHKSUM is another anti-pattern which
just disables whole purpose of LIC_FILES_CHKSUM and this is acceptable only
for "pure-metadata" recipes like packagegroups or image recipes.

Ross,

It is now broken even in hardknott. I tried it, just as I tried it
before (it worked before).

I have no idea what the ERROR is:

Martin, U R too fast. Speedy Gonzales. ;-)

I do agree that this is the bad practice to change licences for the
known recipes. For the can-utils and socketcand. I'll revert this back
to GPLv2.

But, could you, please, allow me to have my own original cannelloni
recipe (yes, I developed it with some help from this community) on my
own terms? I DID not copy it from anywhere. It is an ORIGINAL.

Please, check. Do NOT overspeed. Please.

Thank you for your advice.

As I explained in the bug I filed in your repository, the LICENSE statement is the license of the contents of the packages, not the recipe itself.

https://github.com/mguentner/cannelloni clearly says GPLv2.

Oh no, now the entire Yocto Project world knows about this hack. Now we 
need a sanity checker for this in the insane class. :)

It's a slippery slope. We can also for example make bitbake forcibly
not expand any variables in it, and write out an angry rant when
someone tries, and then I'm sure determined people will find a way
around that too.

Do not bother... This is a war between me and the entire YOCTO
community of founders... It has been going for a while. Lot of INTEL
guys and former INTEL guys against former INTEL guy. Me.

But, I came here with Peace. It seems some people could not overcome their EGOs.

I am trying to ask for a brainstorming. Now, I am trying to
understand, why the backpors took place from kirkstone... Once my
scripts were working for hardknott...

But they do not work anymore.

Well...

Not my fault. Just trying to push forward.

Hi Alexander,

instead of putting shame on people, I would propose, for a prospering
community, to send out hints to maintainers, when an enforced mechanism
is being disabled. I would have just ignored your email if Richard did
not cleared things up with his patch. Thanks.
