Hi guys,
I wanted to know if it is possible to update your application through OTA
updates.
If yes, then please share some documentation or some steps in achieving it.
If not, then what other alternatives do we have to update the
application in our hardware deployed at some remote location.

Thanks
Hassan

I am currently working on a comprehensive list of boards/releases that are
directly supported here: https://hub.mender.io/t/board-support-index/5742 -
please note, heavily WIP still.

For transparency, I do work for Mender. Let me know if you need more
details, or drop your question on https://hub.mender.io

Greetz,
Josef

Also note "ostree", which allows incremental updates and is especially
suited if you want to minimize data usage (for example, over cellular
networks).

https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/introduction/

Basically OSTree is GIT for filesystems.

Regards,

Leon.

The bitbake meta-updater [1] layer provides most of the bits to work with
ostree.
I work for Foundries.io [2] and my company also provides professional OTA
services.
