A few weeks ago, our NFS-mounted sstate-cache was about 748 GB in size. I
ran the script "sstate-cache-management.sh".  It took a very long time
(about two hours) but was able to free up 307 GB of space.

What is the benefit to running that script vs just deleting the
sstate-cache directory entirely?  I know the first build after a delete
will take a long time. But that's offset because just deleting the
directory as a whole doesn't take more than about a minute.

Does deleting the sstate-cache affect the preserv and the autoinc values it
is returning?

Personally, I just delete all files that havenâ€™t been accessed in a month, using find:

find $SSTATE -type f -atime +30 -delete
