What happens when you 'bitbake gdb'?

HI Alexander,

Thanks for your email.

The  'bitbake gdb' runs through successfully. However, I still get the
error for gdbserver when running 'bitbake machine-image'

Thanks
Ash

Can you check whether the gdbserver package is in
tmp/work/.../gdb/deploy-*/ (the gdb WORKDIR), and whether it is in
tmp/deploy/... (packages deploy dir), and then whether it is in
tmp/work/..../machine-image/ (image-specific package repo)? Seems like it
gets lost at some point.

whats your target architecture ? sometimes gdbserver port may not be 
available for a given arch.

I am using the Yocto "thud" version which has long term support.

The architecture used is aarch64-oe-linux

The gdb directory or executables were not created in
tmp/work/.../gdb/deploy-*/ (the gdb WORKDIR), nor in tmp/deploy/...
(packages deploy dir), and neither in tmp/work/..../machine-image/
(image-specific package repo), although the compilation went through
successfully.

Could it be that the architecture "aarch64-oe-linux" is not supported for
gdbserver in Yocto "thud" ?

Regards
Ash

Thud has not been supported for a very long time actually. To really find
out what is happening, it would help if you make an archive of
tmp/work/../gdb/ and put it somewhere for inspection.
