I have busybox with an initramfs. When I try to re-mount the rootfs I
see this. This is with Yocto. Do I need to include systemd in my
initramfs image?

sh-5.0# exec switch_root /root /sbin/init
switch_root: failed to mount moving /run to /root/run: Invalid argument
switch_root: forcing unmount of /run
