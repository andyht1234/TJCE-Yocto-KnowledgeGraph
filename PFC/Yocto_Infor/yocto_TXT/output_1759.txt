Hi,
I have a recipe (See below) for python3-pygit2 which fails at do_compile if I just try to run it via

bitbakeÂ python3-pygit2

However if I instead

bitbake python3-pygit2 -c devhsell

and then

../temp/run.do_compile

It succeeds. Now I'm relatively new to devshell but I thought these were supposed to be equivalent.

How can I figure out what is going on here?
