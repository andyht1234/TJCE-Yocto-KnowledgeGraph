You can add the generic *license.txt* provided by the vendor to
*${LAYERDIR}/custom-licenses/**vendor-lic-ID*

In conf/layer.conf add:
*LICENSE_PATH += "${LAYERDIR}/custom-licenses"*

And in the recipe:

*SRC_URI += "file://license.txt"*
*LICENSE = "**vendor-lic-ID**"*
*LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://license.txt;md5=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"*

Whatever you are setting for LICENSE Variable inside recipe there should be
a file with same name stored inside One of LICENSE_PATH directories.
