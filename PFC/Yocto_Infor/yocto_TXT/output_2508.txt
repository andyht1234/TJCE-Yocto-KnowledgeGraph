Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.5 M1 is due to build this week
*	YP 3.4.1 is likely to be released this week
*	There were some changes to the yocto-check-layer script to verify
more of the contents of README files which has led to improvements in a
number of layer README files.
*	The Yocto Project Summit and OpenEmbedded Developer virtual meetings
last week seemed successful, thanks to the organizers and presenters for
their hard work and presentations and everyone who attended to make it a
success.
*	We have continued to audit a number of the patches in OE-Core with
the removal of quite a number of obsolete patches and a number being
submitted to the appropriate upstreams. This will result in an improvement
to the quality of the core layer and make general maintenance easier going
forward. Any help, particularly from those with knowledge of specific areas
or upstreams would be most welcome.
*	We continue to see a reduction in the number of patches in the
"Pending" state. Many thanks to everyone who has taken the time to review
patch status and handle accordingly, particularly where they were accepted
upstream. This will significantly benefit the project in the long term.
*	Intermittent issues continue to rise and help is very much welcome
on these issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to see by
searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT
*	SWAT handling of autobuilder issues has sadly not been functioning
correctly for the last couple of weeks with a large backlog of untriaged
issues.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
