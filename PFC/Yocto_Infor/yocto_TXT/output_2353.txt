Hi,

I've seen the same for some time now when building core-image-minimal with
yocto state mirror and hashequiv servers.

After some investigation I think the root cause is some
bandwidth/connection limitation on the http yocto mirror.

Reducing the BB_NUMBER_THREADS="1" to a single core solves many of the
fetch issues for me,
my config is the default one with:

  BB_NUMBER_THREADS="1"
  SSTATE_MIRRORS = "file://.*
http://sstate.yoctoproject.org/dev/PATH;downloadfilename=PATH"
  BB_HASHSERVE_UPSTREAM = "typhoon.yocto.io:8687"

This usually happens when there is a sstate archive (.tar.zst), but no
corresponding siginfo file (.tar.zst.siginfo). The sstate code assumes
the siginfo file is present if archive is present, and "errors" if
not. In my experience, this usually happens when you try to clean out
the sstate cache using a mechanism that is unaware of the relationship
and deletes the siginfo and not the archive (e.g. some form of "find
-delete ...")

As noted by the build, it will actually just execute the missing
tasks; one annoyance (depending on context) is that bitbake will
return a non-zero exit code if any ERROR occurs in the build, even
though in this case it was recovered.

This has been discussed at length before (I can't find a citation
ATM), and I believe it was left this way because this particular case
is considered an actual error that should never happen and needs
investigation on the YP Autobuilder.

During the last yocto project summit 2021.11 I have submitted a patch
to reduce the time needed for handling the sstate mirrors on startup,
that without my realizing it actually launches a DoS attack to the mirror.
This patch was rejected as expected.

After that patch, maybe by coincidence I got the idea that some measures
had been taken to mitigate this problem but if it wasn't the case then
there is
a bug in concurrent connections to the YP server.

When the patch was sent there was no problem with the concurrent connections
to the YP server.

Hi,

I have tested the state mirror locally with my own http mirror and it works
perfectly.
There are no problems with the concurrent connections.
I'm more sure that the root cause is some bandwidth/connection limitation
on the http YP mirror.
