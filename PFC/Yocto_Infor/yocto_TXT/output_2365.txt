Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.5 M2 is due to build next week
*	The autobuilder updates have now mostly stabilized and we are
potentially seeing a reduction in intermittent failures.
*	On modern kernels, we now have the capability within bitbake to
disable networking on a per task basis without extra user privileges. There
is discussion on the mailing list on how we should enable this and whether
it should be on an opt-in or opt-out basis. A second patchset has been
proposed for discussion where tasks using the network would need to be
explicitly marked as such.
*	The openssl and webkit reproducibility issues have been fixed.
*	We have also fixed the reproducibility issues with rust-llvm and
golang. With ruby docs disabled, this means we have no reproducibility patch
exclusions in OE-Core, thanks Alex Kanavin!
*	The "oldest kernel" setting used for qemu which is architecture
specific is causing issues for allarch packages but the various patches to
fix it have also caused other issues and highlighted gaps in our sstate hash
tests. There are hopefully now patches ready to merge to fix these issues
and the gaps in testing.
*	CVE issues against master have risen from 7 to 17 so help in
addressing those issues would be very welcome.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at record high levels and help is
very much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
