The parsec-service in meta-parsec has been failing ever since gcc 11 was
merged into core.

https://errors.yoctoproject.org/Errors/Build/123537/

I have already opened an issue with upstream:
https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/issues/85

If anyone is interested in this package, I could use an extra set of
eye's on progress of this build failure.

regards,
Armin

yeah perhaps try using -DMBEDTLS_FATAL_WARNINGS=OFF

I would love to try that out, Where would I apply that?
 mbedtls is a dependent create to a dependent create to parsec-service
recipe.  The Rust paradigm in OE  does make my head hurt.

yeah perhaps you need to fork this repo and let main package know via
editing the toml file perhaps.
