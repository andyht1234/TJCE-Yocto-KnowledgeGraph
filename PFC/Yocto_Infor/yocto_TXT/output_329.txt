I have two images in same custom layer : A-image.bb & B-image.bb

I want to add readline_5.2.bb ( https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-gplv2/tree/recipes-core/readline/readline_5.2.bb ) in A-image.bb & readline_8.2.bb ( https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/tree/meta/recipes-core/readline/readline_8.2.bb ) in B-image.bb. How can I achieve this?

Adding PREFERRED_VERSION in local.conf applies to both the image recipes.

Thanks,

It can not be done at image scope but at config metadata e.g. distro
or machine config.

If you want readline 5.2 (which is very old and may cause security
issues) because you can't ship gpl version 3 code in a product, then a
much better option is to find out what requires readline, and disable
that option, so it isn't installed into images. There are also non-gpl
alternatives such as libedit.
