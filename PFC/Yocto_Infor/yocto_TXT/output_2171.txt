I do am building image on a raspberry pi zero w. After flashing the image on the raspberry, i don get anything on the screen. I am doing this the honister branch. I had the gatesgarth branch and it was working perfectly. I tried many thing but i can't get to work. i have literally the same code on a raspberry pi zero w 2 and it works perfectly. I am only changing the name of the machine (raspberrypi0-wifi ) to get to work. Do you have an idea why ? I have the sensation that it is booting because the green led is flashing but i don't have anything on the screen.

is it possible to hook up serial console and see if you see additional
messages ?
also try with master and see if you have same problem as honister or not

So now after doing the last pull on meta -raspberrypi. The one to change
