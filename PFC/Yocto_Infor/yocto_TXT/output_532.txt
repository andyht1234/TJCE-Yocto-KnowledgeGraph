Hello,

The error I get is the BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE being renamed but from exactly where is this renamed? I have searched in my filesystem w/:

sudo find | grep BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE

No success. I am sure there are reasons. Anyway, here are my ideas I found online to test.

* I clone the argo-project from TI.com
* ./oe-layertool-setup.sh -f configs/arago-kirkstone
* source build/conf/setenv
* Then, the error occurs

I have not been able to search and find the exact placement of this BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE error or I would change it to the new projected methods: BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_ADDITIONS

I have searched online already. I do not exactly see a cure but I see others have had issues revolving around this error.

Seth

P.S. If you have time and understand what exactly I should do to exchange the EXTRAWHITE to PASSTHROUGH_ADDITIONS, please do contact me.

It seems that the variable was the issue.

Seth

P.S. Outdated variables should get updated via the user, i.e. me!
