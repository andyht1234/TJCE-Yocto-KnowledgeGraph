Hello,
this minor patch series bring minor fixes into send-qa-email to ease
development/debugging in it:
- fetching current build test results works well in CI builds because we are
  sure that the build results will be in the 5 upper commits of testsresults
  repository shallow clone (because it has been pushed just before preparing the
  regression report). It is not true when trying to run send-qa-email offline on
  older revisions (for development, debugging or improvement of scripting), so
  we need to force-fetch the target revision as it is done currently for the
  base revision. As a consequence, this new behaviour allows to make even more
  "shallow" clones of testresults since all needed data will be force-fetched
- When downloading a test regression report on official release webserver, we do
  not have information about what base have been used or what is the exact
  tested revision (at least, without checking the corresponding build logs on
  autobuilder). So I propose to add this information at the top of each
  regression report, making it look like this:

========================== Regression report ==============================
=> Target:      master          (5e249ec855517765f4b99e8039cb888ffa09c211)
=> Base:        4.2_M1          (4d19594b8bdacde6d809d3f2a25cff7c5a42295e)
===========================================================================

Match: oeselftest_almalinux-9.1_qemux86-64_20221208113119
       oeselftest_centos-8_qemux86-64_20230126230327
Match: oeselftest_debian-11_qemux86-64_20221208033325
       oeselftest_debian-11_qemux86-64_20230126150229
[...]

I assumed that no tool is currently trying to parse the regression reports, so
I chose arbitrarily the metadata format.

@Richard : on a side note, the broken From field in my previous emails was probably
due to an accent in my name, it should be fixed now. Please let me know if you
still have issues with this, in this case I will force the --from field.

If we try to run send-qa-email to simulate past releases (for example, for
development or debugging), the execution will very likely fail because the
target revision to examine (ie: the poky revision) is too old, and as a
consequence is not contained in the testresults shallow clone anymore (because
testsresults history keeps moving forward as builds are triggered on
autobuilder). As a consequence, force-fetch the "target" revision, as it is
already done for the "base" revision

Since we are now force-fetching base revisions and target revisions for
regression report generation, we can make testresults clone even more "shallow"
to increase clone speed in CI pipelines

Current regression reports do not contain information about versions compared
when generating reports. While it is still possible to get the information by
searching the autobuilder log, it is not convenient. Moreover, future
developments will allow to generate multiple reports (with different bases for
comparison) in a single build.
As a consequence, embed target and base revisions in the report header

The reports have never been useful enough to parse so that should be
fine.

It still shows incorrectly for me. It is an issue with the bootlin mail
setup and DNS, not to do with the character encoding. My changing the
accent, it is now duplicating the signed off by lines so I'd avoid
doing that!

Cheers,

Richard

Well, that's a shame, sorry for the annoyance. Once the patches are approved or
lead to a v2, I will resend with "From:" forced, except if you want me to
re-send it right now.
