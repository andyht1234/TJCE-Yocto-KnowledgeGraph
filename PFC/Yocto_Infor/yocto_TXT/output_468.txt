Greetings,

I know that we are still testing and supporting Ubuntu 18.04, but should 
we go on doing it?

This version no longer has public updates, so unless we have a 
subscription with Canonical, we are going to be out of sync with the 
updates that Ubuntu 18.04 subscribers get.

What do you think?
Cheers
Michael.

Even if we would have a subscription with Canonical, it would not be
fair to ask contributors to fix issues that occur only on distribution
available through commercial channels. So yes, it should be dropped
ASAP.

This isn't as simple as you'd think.

The x86 worker will be dropped when maintenance comes around to that
point on the autobuilder, it is in the queue.

The ARM worker worries me a lot more. The 1804 worker is currently
stable but I do worry a bit what will happen when we change the OS on
that machine. In theory it should be fine and it could well be but that
hardware was very painful in the past.

I appreciate the idealist "lets drop it ASAP" but there are other
things to consider. Do we want to lose Michael Halstead and myself for
a couple of weeks trying to fix a new OS on it? Do we want to lose a
third of our ARM build power?

Cheers,

Richard

But can we ask ARM folks to sort this out, and preferably well ahead
of EOL dates in the future? They had pushed heavily for ARM as the
first class build host, so both hardware and software on the AB is on
them.

Each Arm worker runs a different release of Ubuntu, so I’ve no problem with asking Michael to reimage the 1804 machine with something newer (maybe even something not-Debian for coverage).  If it suddenly becomes less stable that would be a very interesting datapoint!

Interesting, yes. If it breaks, I suspect the official advice will be
to scrap that machine rather than fix it though and we'll then be down
on build power :/.

Richard

FWIW we swapped out our x86_64 build machines for Aarch64 build
machines (both 20.04) in AWS with pretty much zero pain - it went way
better than I was expecting. That said we don't run ptests, or qemu,
or ...

Sure, our meta-arm CI is 90% running on graviton3, this isn’t an “arm is inherently unstable” thing but rather that some of the current physical arm workers were unstable: reporting core temperatures of several hundred degrees celsius and shutting down, etc. Halstead resolved the problems in the end but it wasn’t trivial.

The worker running 1804 is the oldest and by far the slowest, but it’s also been - so far - the most reliable.

To be clear I'm not saying there is any problem in general with ARM
machines! We just know that particular hardware, we had a lot of issues
when we first set it up. Since we got the config right it has behaved a
lot more reliably than the others. Changing the OS introduces risk and
my question was whether we wanted to rush into that, particularly as it
risks the machine being written off if things go badly, I was already
under pressure about that as it is getting old. Things have got better
since and nobody is interested on support on that particular older
system.

Cheers,

Richard
