  on admittedly unsupported ubuntu 22.04 platform but it's clear this
is a known issue as it's pretty much identical to what one reads here:

  https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/issues/1427

the explanation being that, "not every atomic operation is currently
supported by GCC on RISC-V."

  oddly, building a riscv64 core-image-minimal once upon a time on
fedora worked just fine, so i'm assuming a difference in gcc versions
is what is causing this.

  what is the recommended workaround for this?
