Replace hardknott with honister in layer.conf which aligns with
oe-core.

I had added this back in April, but apparently didn't push the change.

I also noticed that I've been updating the wrong branch with compatibility.

That should all be fixed now.

Hi Bruce,

Thanks. I have seen your commits.

But 3 items in LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_realtime will cause layer index show 
warning:

 Â  WARNING: YPCompatibleVersion.name: dunfell gatesgarth hardknott: 
length 28 exceeds maximum (25), truncating

Could we only keep the latest LAYERSERIES_CORENAMES (honister) in branch 
master, please?

Or it set in oe-core's layer.conf:

LAYERSERIES_CORENAMES = "hardknott honister"

we just align with it to keep the latest 2, please?

Regards,
Kai

Nope. It is compatible with those releases, so they need to stay. I
see no valid reason to be limited to a certain number of characters.

That is just as arbitrary, I'll keep it as-is.

I took a quick look, is this warning coming from the layer index ?
That would be important information to convey when sending changes
like this.

That being said, it is a longer fix to get that warning changed, and
I'd rather not break the index, so I dropped to only the last two
releases.

But I do recommend that the layer index be changed (if that is the
cause of the warning), since we shouldn't be adapting to the index ..
it should be adapting to layers.

Apologies on this, I see in the follow up email you did mention the
layerindex .. I read completely over that, and had to search up the
warning myself. (my fault, not yours).

Layerindex should allow longer compatible version names
