Hello everyone,

Say I built Yocto for the latest build for instance Hardknott. Let’s say I need to build for Zeus instead (and hopefully keep everything I built [that doesn’t need to be updated]).

Has anyone done this?

Outside of building a whole new Yocto distribution from scratch… What else can I do?

I have to rebuild Yocto with an older version because apparently there is some issue with Uboot that is not able to be built correctly.

Hello

IIRC you can prepare configuration for Zeus and run build, lots of things probable will need to be rebuild

as there will be in different versions but if only U-Boot is a problem then maybe you could stay on Hardknott

version and only change the U-Boot version? Could you please share some more information about your build?

Which layers are you using? Do you have some custom layer?

Greetings
