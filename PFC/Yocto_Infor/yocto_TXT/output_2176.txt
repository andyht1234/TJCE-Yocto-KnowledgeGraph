There are some intermittent issues with the script not publishing all
versions. So let's go extreme and fail the script if any error happens:
 - a command returns a non-zero code, even if piped,
 - a variable is used uninitialized,

This also makes the script print each and every command being run so we
have a better idea where the script struggles.

RFC:
 - I highly suspect this change to break the building script because
 Sphinx probably throws errors at old doc builds,
 - Also, with Sphinx updates, new warnings might arrise on
 old/unmaintained branches, we probably want to use virtualenv with
 specific Sphinx versions to make sure this is not an issue in the
 future? (and allows to bump Sphinx (or other dependencies) requirement
 for newer doc branches),

Agreeing with the change.
How would we get the script output?

Thanks
