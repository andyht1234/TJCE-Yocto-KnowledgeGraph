Check available sound cards in your system. 'aplay -L' It seems you have 
no suitable default one for speaker-test to use. If you have sound cards 
in your machine and want to point out another one that speaker-test 
shall use you can pass that as an argument.

Hi Peter,

After entering " *aplay -l* " I got message " *aplay: device_list:274 : no soundcards found...* ".

I am using virtual machine: *VMware workstation with ubuntu 20.4.3 as a Linux host machine.*
Running Image: *core-image-minimal* using *run qemu* *qemux86-64 nographic*

Thanks
Mihir
