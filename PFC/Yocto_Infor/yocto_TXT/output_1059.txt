Hello, community!

While writing some python-based recipes using setuptools3 I have noticed
that ${datadir} is always installed in the staging area even though there
is no content under it. This causes QA issues. I found out that the
distutils bbclass contains the following line which causes this behavior:

DISTUTILS_INSTALL_ARGS ?= "--root=${D} \
    --prefix=${prefix} \
    --install-lib=${PYTHON_SITEPACKAGES_DIR} \
    *--install-data=${datadir}*"

Is there a reason for installing ${datadir} always, regardless of what the
build system specifies either in setup.py or in do_install[_append]?

So far my workaround is to remove this flag from DISTUTILS_INSTALL_ARGS. I
did it first on a per-recipe basis and now I am thinking of doing it
globally by overriding the distuitls bbclass with my own version that
requires the original and then removes the flag. Are there any concerns
that I should be aware of?

Best regards,
Alexandru N. Onea

distutils has been removed from upcoming python 3.12, so I don't think
anyone would be particularly interested in what that class is doing :)
The concern should be what are you going to do with all these recipes
when you will be transitioning to a version of yocto without
distutils.
