I fixed a json parsing issue and merged. I also added the autobuilder2
config to support it. A test build is now running here:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/156/builds/1

Cheers,

Richard

That failed with a single fetch failure which isn't related to this
patch.

I've therefore pulled the patch into the dunfell, kirkstone and
mickledore branches.

Autobuilder enabling is here:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-autobuilder2/commit/?id=93c034d436cbe631db2354a945850c3e97dd46bd

with scheduling for the all branches here:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-autobuilder2/commit/?id=94f2878f64f11993e8de8295bb1b46202b741019

Cheers,

Richard

Master reran and succeeded this time but is showing a lot of warnings:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/156/builds/2/steps/12/logs/warnings

Kirkstone has an issue with grubby-git and a missing SRCREV:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/156/builds/3/steps/13/logs/stdio
(plus warnings)

Mickledore has an issue with uutils-coreutils:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/156/builds/5
(plus warnings)

Dunfell broke with space issues so I reran it here:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/156/builds/6

So we're making progress but the meta-oe layer maintainers may need
some tweaks on the same branches or we need to see some missing files
into the mirror for those branches. We also need to find a way to
address the warnings.

Cheers,

Richard
