It is clear that the build system cannot find anything that is providing 'python-hello' recipe.

Which means it parsed all layers in bblayers.conf and it didn't find any python-hello_*.bb file (the _* is the version)

It is mentioned in the tutorial that you provided that the recipe should be in meta-layer/recipes-custom/python-hello

So, you need to create that layer, follow:

bitbake-layers create-layer meta-custom
bitbake-layers add-layer meta-custom

Now, in that layer create folders: recipes-custom/python-hello, in that you should have:

1. another folder: files in that you put python-hello.py
2. python-hello.bb

the content of all of that is in the tutorial .
