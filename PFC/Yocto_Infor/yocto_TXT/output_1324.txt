It happened that the git repositories were dirty and resulted in
incorrect files being used. Let's use git clean -ffdx to force a
completely clean git repositories before and after checking out a branch
so that nothing is left from or to another branch build

Forgot to say this was not tested. Let's run this on the autobuilder and 
see if it helps? Is there a way to try without merging?

Cheers,
Quentin

In both cases, why "-ffdx"? Isn't it the same as "-fdx" (just checking 
the manual page).

Sure this is correct? 'git clean -ffdx' does not revert changes to
tracked files, be them staged or not.

The manpage for git 2.34.1 has this extra detail:

Nope, not sure this is correct. I misread git clean manpage, we should 
have a git reset --hard and git clean -ffdx. Now the question is when 
those are necessary because with this patch we do it twice, before and 
after the git checkout. I did this because I remember doing checkouts 
between branches of U-Boot/kernel and while the pre-checkout branch was 
not dirty, the after-checkout branch was dirty. I assume this might have 
something to do with build artifacts of the pre-checkout build that 
weren't .gitignored in the afer-checkout branch? Something that git 
clean -ffdx should tackle I think.

Sooo, I guess only having git reset --hard and git clean -ffdx before a 
checkout should be enough and we don't need them both before and after 
the checkout like I did in this patch?

Cheers,
Quentin

I think 'reset --hard' + 'clean -ffdx' only before the checkout should
be enough. However I'm not sure whether there are corner cases such as
a file that is .gitignored in commit A and versioned in commit B or
similar. Perhaps worth trying with reset+clean only before, and see
what happens. However I don't know exactly the initial problem you're
trying to fix.
