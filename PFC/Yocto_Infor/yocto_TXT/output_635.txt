Using TOPDIR variable breaks the sstate-cache every time build directory
changes totally breaking build from sstate-cache among different workspaces.

Changing that to TMPDIR that is included in BB_HASHEXCLUDE_COMMON.

Another thing is disabling the UNINATIVE_LOADER, causing sstate-cache
artifacts not working in different workspaces. On
populate_sysroot_setscene patchelf-uninative --set-interpreter with
empty argument is ran which does not change the interpreter path and
then bazel binary ends up with path to the interpreter that might not
exist, since the bazel was taken from sstate-cache.

Removing the UNINATIVE_LOADER = "" so that uninative.bbclass can
correctly replace the interpreter path and make bazel binary usable.
One could think that it will reintroduce the original issue behind
disabling uninative, which was some java file corrupted (see commit
dd7642b), but I think we don't have this problem anymore and also I
don't think it was the correct solution - since the loader is anyway
included in the binary, so it wasn't really disabling it, just disabling
the yocto functionality around uninative. If the error re-occurs I think
different solution should be found.
