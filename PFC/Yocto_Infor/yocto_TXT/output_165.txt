Hi, all

I have two distros in the same meta layer, "A" and "B," and a recipe which installs a configuration file existing in a layer elsewhere. "A" and "B" should provide different configuration files, overriding the original configuration. It seems less than ideal to create a bbappend in this scenario as that would require the bbappend to know about the various distros and even handle the case where neither distro is chosen, some other "C" distro may be built for. My goal is a distro-centric configuration rather than a recipe/package-centric one. How can I do this? Does this align with the framework, or should I be looking into a different solution for this problem?

Thank you,
Logan

The distro name is already part of FILESOVERRIDES so you can just add 
your configuration file in a directory named after your distro. e.g. 
provided your distro is called logan-distro, the following makes it 
possible to override the configuration file from another layer:

```
# cat recipes-foo/bar/bar-1.0.0/logan-distro/file.conf
meh
# cat recipes-foo/bar/bar_1.0.0.bbappend
FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}-${PV}:"
```

no need to modify anything else if the file.conf file is added via 
SRC_URI mechanism, otherwise you'll need to add a bit more to the 
bbappend (or use patches instead), probably via a do_configure:prepend 
or even do_patch:append (I think the file fetcher also allows to install 
directly in the proper directory via subdir= parameter?).

Cheers,
Quentin

Hi, Quentin

Ah, this is great. This looks exactly like what I was looking for. I appreciate the timely response.

Thank you,
Logan
