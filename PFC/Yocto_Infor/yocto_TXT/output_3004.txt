Hi,

I am using *ubuntu 16.04* (host) in VirtualBox.

Memory allocated to VM machine is 100+ GB.

Poky *dunfell*.

While trying to build the project fo *r x86_64.*

Steps followed as per yocto quick guide for "dunfell"

////////////////////////////// ////////////////////////////// ////////////

after baking 54% of recipe I am getting error.

Looks to me that your VM ran out of SDRAM memory,
allocated for the VM, somehow.

> Memory allocated to VM machine is 100+ GB.

It is (hopefully) a VDI (Dynamic) VM disk image, NOT a SDRAM,
my best guess.

[1] You can just try to continue bitbake process, it might pass, since the
     Bitbake processes were forcefully killed, and some memory hogged
     fortunately were entirely deallocated;
[2] If [1] fails again a few times, you can try to reconfigure VMM to give
     more SDRAM to VM (have no idea what is the allocated default), it
     might help!

Previously SDRAM was 3 GB allocated.

After changing SDRAM to 4 GB.
then trying to build/make/bitbake..

getting new error i.e.
Unable to connect to bitbake server

keep in mind that based upon how many vcores you allocate to VM will
determine memory pressure
as well. So if you have 2 cores perhaps 4GB is ok or maybe even 4
cores might workout ok but some bigger packages like
chromium etc. need minimal 16GB RAM to build.

this seems that it finds bitbake is still running and its trying to
reconnect to it. Maybe just reboot the box and try again

This should be reflected somewhere in YOCTO documentation. Especially
for chromium.

In the section: Host HW Requirements (with some explanation why).
