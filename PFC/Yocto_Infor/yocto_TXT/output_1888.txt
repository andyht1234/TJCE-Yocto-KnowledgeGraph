Dear Yocto developers,

Is there a way to generate an SDK which contains the toolchain for
bare-metal systems (i.e. MCU without operating system)?

Thanks in advance!

Ciao,
Alessio

Hi Alessio,

Have you had a look at crosstool-ng?

Best regards, Laurent.

Good question. I know Xilinx has put effort to support their MCUs with Yocto.

However, define what you mean by SDK? Which libraries or programming
languages are you thinking of beyond the C library for example?

crosstool-ng is mostly the toolchain, I would not consider this an SDK
beyond that.

This might help:

its possible to build baremetal toolchains, e.g. look at meta-riscv 
baremetal machines e.g.


https://github.com/riscv/meta-riscv/blob/master/conf/machine/baremetal-riscv32.conf


you can do

MACHINE=baremetal-riscv32 bitbake meta-toolchain

Which will give you a toolchain, but if you want more like what we can 
do with MCU OSes like freertos and zephyr take a look at

meta-zephyr (https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-zephyr/) and 
meta-freertos (https://github.com/aehs29/meta-freertos)

Hi Alessio,

meta-arm have some binary baremetal toolchains for arm and aarch64 at:
https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-arm/tree/meta-arm-toolchain/recipes-devtools/external-arm-toolchain
