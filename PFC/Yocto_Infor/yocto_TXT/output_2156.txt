Hello everyone,

I don't know if it is the right place or if my question belong more in the
- openembedded-architecture mailing list.

I'm trying to build an image with my Qt5 based application. I know which
Qt5 component I need to build and to run my application but I'm struggeling
to understand what are the corresponding recipes to put in DEPENDS and
RDEPENDS according to the components I use.

For example: if I want to build a graphical application with image display
support I would need (if I understand correctly):
for svg support: qtsvg in RDEPENDS
but for gif support: qtbase in DEPENDS with  PACKAGECONFIG_append = "gif"
in a qtbase_%.bbappend
It is a little bit confusing for me.

My question is:
Is there any documentation or table mapping Qt5 components or libraries and
the corresponding recipe in the meta-Qt5 layer (with the correct
PACKAGEGROUP to set if needed)?

Thank you very much,
Have a great day,

Hi Perceval,

Just a rough guess, I think you want qtsvg in DEPENDS for svg support
and/or
qtbase in DEPENDS for gif support. I don't know of any mapping but the
recipes
seem to align quite clearly with the components. And I think you can ignore
setting
RDEPENDS manually.

Typically the RDEPENDS do not need to be done manually and it is handled
auto-magically [1]. When the packaging is done, the task scans the elf
headers to
find what libraries are depended on. i.e. It'll see if your app depends on
the
qtsvg lib. From there, it determines automatically which package provides
that
lib and adds it to the rdeps of the package data. Adding to RDEPENDS
manually
is normally only needed if you have something the scanner cannot pick up on
automatically. (eg. shell scripts that have dependencies, dynamically
injected
libs, etc).

Been awhile since I did anything with qt5, pretty sure the libs are linked
in a
normal sense that the scanner will detect the rdepends automatically.

Kind regards,
Michael
