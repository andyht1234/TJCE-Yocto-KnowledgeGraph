NEWBIE question!

I tried building and I get: "_Specified SDKMACHINE value is not valid_"

pi@raspberrypi ~/p/build> bitbake core-image-minimal
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/html5lib/_trie/_base.py:3: 
DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' 
instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop

misconfiguration.
     Either fix the cause of this error or at your own risk disable the

     Following is the list of potential problems / advisories:

     Specified SDKMACHINE value is not valid

Summary: There was 1 WARNING message shown.
Summary: There was 1 ERROR message shown, returning a non-zero exit 
code.
I've tried setting SDKMACHINE to 'arm' and 'qemuarm' but get the same 
message?

Obviously I failed to do something (properly)?

Ideas?

As per https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-SDKMACHINE
the value isn't a target MACHINE, but a name that is present in
conf/machine-sdk:

https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/tree/meta/conf/machine-sdk

If you want to build a SDK to run on an arm host, you most likely want
aarch64.  A 32-bit Arm SDK hasn't been tested, but writing a new
configuration file for that shouldn't be that difficult.

MACHINE = "raspberrypi3"
(for example, pick your specific one like
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-raspberrypi/tree/conf/machine
)

Building the SDK for an architecture other than x86 is not supported
at the moment. But again, this is about the SDK. And you probably just
want to build the image, where the standard procedures apply. Add the
BSP layer, set MACHINE.

Not quite true, aarch64 is supported and tested as an SDKMACHINE value.

Right, this sounds like MACHINE is wanted for raspberrypi.

Cheers,

Richard

at one point, I had ppc64le working as SDKMACHINE target as well.

I'm trying an experiment building yocto/OE on a Raspberry Pi 4 to host 
on the same RP4. Admittedly, a not practical platform for this purpose 
but it should work.

I'm trying to target the ARM ISA for the image using yocto-3.4.2. I've 
tried simply using the default setting and end up with:

_ERROR:  OE-core's config sanity checker detected a potential 
misconfiguration._
_    Either fix the cause of this error or at your own risk disable the 
checker (see sanity.conf)._
_    Following is the list of potential problems / advisories:_
_ _
_    Specified SDKMACHINE value is not valid_

I've tried editing ./conf/local.conf:

MACHINE ?= "qemuarm64"

#MACHINE ??= "qemux86-64"

But this accomplishes nothing. Needless to say, I'm a yacto/OE newbie, 
so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

---John
