A question specifically to Denys, how can I actually get this into the

Michael,

Would it be possible to create 2 additional branches in the meta-lts-mixins 
repository at https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-lts-mixins/ called 
"dunfell/go" and also "dunfell/docker" and give Alex push rights to them?

Please let us know, thanks a lot!

Checkout the branches from the same repo into two different directories.
Yes this is unusual, and slightly confusing. But that way the branches can
be maintained and included into builds independently.

Thanks Michael!
Adrian, the branches are now available:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-lts-mixins

so I'm ready to take any patches you would like to have there, pls send
them via this mailing list. Otherwise I'll get the branches updated to
latest component versions.

Alex

Yes, but this way it 'just works'. I do not think writing complicated
instructions in README for what needs to be in local.conf or distro config
is a better alternative. Suggestions welcome.

Just out of curiosity: I thought the agreement was that neither 
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_* nor recipe/provider specific settings should be 
part of a layer.conf
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_go-native as a hard assignment might be troublesome 
in some setups (mainly depending on what order bblayers.conf actually has)
