Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.3.1 was released
*	YP 3.1.8 is being built, an autobuilder glitch meant we're building
rc2.
*	We've seen a significant reduction in CVE counts for master and the
stable releases this week. For master this brings us down to 5 CVEs compared
to 63 a couple of weeks ago. This should mean real/open issues are much
clearer and old/obsolete issues no longer contribute noise to the output of
the tools.
*	Help with the problematic recipe upgrades would be much appreciated.
*	The multiconfig changes in bitbake continue to cause problems, we
still need simpler test cases to reproduce issues rather than huge builds.
The existing patches seem to fix some workloads and break others. Richard is
trying to fix but trying to fix autobuilder issues and other problems and
these are slow builds to debug.
*	We have identified ltp issues with some tests causing hangs which
have been disabled as well as issues with the 5.10.37 kernel which seem to
be fixed in 5.10.38.
*	We're seeing odd looking rcu stalls in qemu automated testing. This
seems to occur more often with 5.10 kernel but also with 5.12 and with
kvm-clock disabled and we have seen it with 5.4. It is unclear whether these
are kernel issues or qemu issues, we're struggling to debug them and any
insight would be welcome.
*	Some debugging of these intermittent hangs has been posted to the
swat mailing list.
*	Intermittent autobuilder issues continue to occur and are now at a
record high level. You  can see the list of failures we're continuing to see
by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We are working to identify the load pattern on the infrastructure that seems
to trigger these.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
