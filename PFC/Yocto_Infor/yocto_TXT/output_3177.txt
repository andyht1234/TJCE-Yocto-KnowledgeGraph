When using dtparam, dtoverlay converts /proc/device-tree to a .dtb and
loads it. However, if dtc is not installed, this operation cannot be
done and every call to dtparam fails.

Therefore, dtc needs to be added to the list of userland dependencies
in order to properly call dtparam.

Hi Massimo,

Somehow I've managed to miss this patch. Could you review this on the current branch version? This looks good to me but would need to be rebased.

Thanks,
Andrei
