Hi list,

Random question: does anyone know of a (nice) way to install a package
file, rpm or ipk, that is generated by a 3rd party yocto build, but for
which we don't have the recipe?

Cheers,
Chris

Yes: you need to write a recipe :)

The key part is:
SRC_URI = "path/to/package.rpm"

oe-core has code that would unpack the rpm into ${WORKDIR} and then
you can install and repackage the content as you please with standard
recipe tasks. The usual warnings about using evil vendor blobs apply;
I would have the senior management sign off on that ;)
