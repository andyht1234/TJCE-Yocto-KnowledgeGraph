This allows to switch to a more recent of Sphinx
which will generate warnings with old versions of docs.

This way, it's not immediately necessary to patch
all such versions.

What about doing this for all branches except master? To have at least 
some checks and not completely disable the warnings.

I'm a bit afraid we'll just not care about warnings anymore since they 
won't fail the autobuilder anymore. I also understand it's not really 
sustainable to leave them on for old docs since they won't be maintained 
at one point in time but we still very mnuch would like to be able to 
build them.

Not sure what's the best solution here right now unfortunately :/

Cheers,
Quentin

Enabling them for master could be a compromise, I'd take such a patch
(Michael is away for a while).

Richard

Some warnings are actually valid. Such is the case for the one that 
warranted 
https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-docs/commit/?id=9a797dedf6708da3e7ce789c5c8735e5d891cde4. 
The issue is that we build the docs from old versions with the same 
version of sphinx. Therefore, this patch fixes the issue in master but 
should also be backported to all other impacted versions, even the 
unmaintained ones. See 
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dunfell/dev-manual/dev-manual-common-tasks.html#recipe-syntax, 
instead of a link we now have a path between quotes.

There are two ways to fix that one warning:
  - add intersphinx_disabled_reftypes=[] in conf.py manually from the 
run-docs-build script, c.f. 
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html#confval-intersphinx_disabled_reftypes
  - patch all (tagged and branch) releases from 3.2 to current master in 
scripts/docs-build-patches,

I prefer the second option because it feels less hacky, but that means 
MANY times the same file added to docs-build-patches directory.

The same could be done for the patch I just sent for yocto-docs to use 
the %s substitution characters for the cve extlinks to fix a warning. We 
could just apply this patch to affected releases (kirkstone-4.0.1 tag + 
kirkstone branch). I could technically request a backport to yocto-docs 
kirkstone branch, the only thing I don't like is bumping the min version 
requirement for sphinx for a release that was already released, but if 
that's okay with you, we could avoid having to add patches in the 
autobuilder for every new tagged release of kirkstone.

I'm honestly not sure there's a lot of benefit in disabling the warnings 
for now, or enabling them only for select releases. I understand that 
this increases the maintenance burden on unmaintained branches every 
time we update the sphinx binary in the docs buildtools. However, we 
missed this new broken link for almost a month now, which shows we don't 
look at successful docs build logs from the autobuilder.

Cheers,
Quentin

Perhaps it is time we split the master build from the stable releases
and used different buildtools tarballs for them?

That has it's own set of challenges of course too.
