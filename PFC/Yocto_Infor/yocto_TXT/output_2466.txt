Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.5 M1 is in QA
*	YP 3.1.13 is due to build this week
*	We have maintenance to the autobuilder planned to fit SSDs to speed
up IO and update the host distros to more modern equivalents. If parts
arrive as planned, this is scheduled for next week (20th-24th) and the
autobuilder will be unavailable during the work. There may be bring up
issues with the new distros.
*	There were significant improvements in patch metrics this week with
large drops in both patches in the pending state and overlap number of
patches. Thanks to everyone who contributed to that!
*	As part of patch cleanup, some changes were made which could impact
other layers or our spectrum of support. The libtool prefix patches were
dropped as the need was largely obsolete by recipe specific sysroots,
hosttools and other developments and this may mean patches in other layers
can be dropped too. Some non-upstream invasive mips and sh4 patches were
dropped as they were either obsolete or there were less invasive ways to
handle them. 
*	CVE metrics improved this week with drops in open CVEs for both
dunfull and master.
*	Intermittent issues continue to rise and help is very much welcome
on these issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to see by
searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
