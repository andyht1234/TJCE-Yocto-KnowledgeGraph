Hi all,

I'm trying to debug this issue for quite a while but couldn't get any helpful indication on how to solve it.
(In case it matters, the build runs on a docker container with shared volumes for SSTATE and Downloads. )

The issue: First image build works ok. But "bitbake -c clean packagegroup-modules-test" and rebuild generates the error message below.
- my_dev package is inside packagegroup-modules-test.

ERROR: core-image-test-1.0-r0 do_rootfs: Unable to install packages. Command '/long_path/core-image-test/1.0-r0/recipe-sysroot-native/usr/bin/apt-get  install --allow-downgrades --allow-remove-essential --allow-change-held-packages --allow-unauthenticated --no-remove __many_packages_here__ packagegroup-modules-test' returned 100:

Thanks for any help!
