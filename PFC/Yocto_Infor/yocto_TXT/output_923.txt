Hi,


I want to activate debuginfod server in yocto 3.1.17 but I get error: Error:
Unable to find 'debuginfod'. I added following in local.conf

PACKAGECONFIG_pn-elfutils-native = "debuginfod libdebuginfod"
DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " debuginfod"

and run bitbake elfutils-native -caddto_recipe_sysroot and then when I
run oe-run-native
elfutils-native debuginfod -- verbose -U ./tmp/deploy/ipk/cortexa9t2hf-neon/


bitbake gives error that debuginfod is not found.

It looks following paths
./build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/elfutils-native/0.178-r0/recipe-sysroot-native/usr/bin
.

How can I solve the problem?

Thanks.

I think you need to inspect the ${WORKDIR} of elfutils-native in
detail, particularly the build and install logs in temp/. Does
elfutils ./configure get the right options, and does it end up
enabling debuginfod? Is the executable built and installed into ${B}?

The elfutils recipe in 3.1.17 doesn’t support debuginfod. The version of elfutils does (although it was the first release, so may be buggy), so you can either backport the changes needed, or upgrade to a newer release of Yocto.
