Hi,

I'm working on master oe core master branch and run into problem with file for nativesdk (buildtools tarball).
File started to use MAGIC variable initialized from .../environment-setup.d/file.sh, like

/usr/local/oe-sdk-hardcoded-buildpath/sysroots/x86_64-xesdk-linux/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc

This path relocation does not covered by relocate_sdk.sh script.

Commit that change behavior from wrapper that use relative path to environment variable with absolute path is:

commit 47db876d09d9a4394048579c21d0b394450ce681
Author: Chen Qi <Qi.Chen@windriver.com>
Date:   Tue Jan 17 12:06:30 2023 +0800

    file: export MAGIC in SDK

    Previously, a wrapper is used for file, which adds '--magic-file'
    option to it. But other components might use libmagic and in such
    case, if there's no MAGIC environent variable set correctly, things
    do not work. For example, rpmbuild makes use of libmagic and it
    requries MAGIC to be set correctly.

I think there is a mistake in the file recipe (and rpm has the problem too):

        cat <<- EOF > ${D}${SDKPATHNATIVE}/environment-setup.d/file.sh
                export MAGIC="$OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT${datadir}/misc/magic.mgc"
        EOF

$OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT should be prefixed with a \ to prevent shell
variable expansion at build time.

Can you check that the problem is then fixed?

On closer look, it should even say:
export MAGIC="\$OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc"

If you can test this and confirm that it works, a patch would be welcome.

Hi,

I have problem with reproducibility of this issue.

What I did: build buildtools tarball and install it
Than build sdk with this buildtools tarball.


  1.  No changes. Buildtools tarball installed and relocated into.
/nobackup/oobitots/btt-master/sysroots/x86_64-xesdk-linux/usr/bin/file point to file.file actual binary that use MAGIC
/nobackup/oobitots/btt-master/sysroots/x86_64-xesdk-linux/environment-setup.d/file.sh contains:
export MAGIC="/usr/local/oe-sdk-hardcoded-buildpath/sysroots/x86_64-xesdk-linux/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc"
  2.   Fix file recipe as recommended with escaping dollar sign and reinstall tarball. Got strange results.
/nobackup/oobitots/btt-master/sysroots/x86_64-xesdk-linux/environment-setup.d/file.sh contains:
export MAGIC="OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT/nobackup/oobitots/btt-master/sysroots/x86_64-xesdk-linux/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc", i.e.
proper path but OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT not replaced with value
  3.   Cleanup and retest option (a). Get proper path
export MAGIC="/nobackup/oobitots/btt-master/sysroots/x86_64-xesdk-linux/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc"

And I can't reproduce the issue with magic path. Probably it was an issue on my side with inproper initialization or something.

But still even with proper path to the magic file I have initial issue:

ERROR: quilt-native-0.67-r0 do_populate_sysroot: Fatal errors occurred in subprocesses:
Command '['file', '-b', '/nobackup/oobitots/sdk-master/test-file/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/quilt-native/0.67-r0/sysroot-destdir/nobackup/oobitots/sdk-master/test-file/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/quilt-native/0.67-r0/recipe-sysroot-native/usr/share/quilt/compat/sendmail']' returned non-zero exit status 1.

It looks like 'file' executed during do_package is unable to find magic, so environment have no such MAGIC value.

Trying to test with bitbake quilt-native -c devshell

oobitots-> echo $MAGIC
/nobackup/oobitots/btt-master/sysroots/x86_64-xesdk-linux/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc

Hi. After debugging this, I found there is another issue apart from the way MAGIC is set in the recipe.

The do_populate_sysroot task doesn't use the value of MAGIC variable that is available in tasks that build the code.
`file -b` is invoked from is_elf function in meta/lib/oe/package.py via `subprocess.check_output`.
The environment of that subprocess call doesn't have the MAGIC variable set so `file -b` fails.
(It uses `file` from $BUILDDIR/tmp/hosttools/file)
Verified this by providing a modified env with hardcoded MAGIC to `subprocess.check_output` after which the error is gone.

What would the right solution for this look like?

Regards,
Oleksandr

Before we think of a solution, can you provide steps or a test case where
the issue can be seen? It’s in one of the most important tasks, so I’d like
to know why it hasn’t been a problem and what is the scenario where it is.

I think it hasn’t been noticed because openembedded-core doesn't build `file` in buildtools-tarball.

To reproduce the error, you need to do the following:
1. Download openembedded-core and bitbake, source init script
2. Add nativesdk-file to TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TASK, e.g. add the following line to conf/local.conf:
TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TASK:append = " nativesdk-file"
3. Run `bitbake buildtools-tarball`
4. Install buildtools: `tmp-glibc/deploy/sdk/x86_64-buildtools-nativesdk-standalone-nodistro.0.sh -y -d $buildtools_install_dir`
5. Same as (1) but in a different empty directory (first one built the buildtools, this one will use them)
6. Source the script provided by buildtools, e.g.: `source $buildtools_install_dir/environment-setup-x86_64-oesdk-linux`
7. Run `bitbake quilt-native`

You should get the following error:

ERROR: quilt-native-0.67-r0 do_populate_sysroot: Fatal errors occurred in subprocesses:
Command '['file', '-b', '/path/to/openembedded-core/build/tmp-glibc/work/x86_64-linux/quilt-native/0.67-r0/sysroot-destdir/path/to/openembedded-core/build/tmp-glibc/work/x86_64-linux/quilt-native/0.67-r0/recipe-sysroot-native/usr/bin/quilt']' returned non-zero exit status 1.

The same error is repeated for each invocation of `file` in do_populate_sysroot

Regards,
Oleksandr

I think you might want to use create_wrapper helper, similar to how
createrepo_c recipe does it:

do_install:append:class-nativesdk() {
        create_wrapper ${D}/${bindir}/createrepo_c \
                RPM_CONFIGDIR=${SDKPATHNATIVE}${libdir_nativesdk}/rpm \
                MAGIC=${datadir}/misc/magic.mgc
        create_wrapper ${D}/${bindir}/modifyrepo_c \
                MAGIC=${datadir}/misc/magic.mgc

}

I also just checked that MAGIC is relocated and exported correctly,
e.g. running file from the buildtools tarball works fine on the
'plain' command line after installing and setting up the tarball.

Hi Alexander.

We already use temporary fix, like:

I would like to ask if it possible to have in upstream both MAGIC variable exported and wrapper for file.
If another binaries use MAGIC it's ok, but if we have to use file in sub-shell it must work too.

Oleksiy

It's fine to have both, you just need to write a good commit message
explaining the issue. Also you need to explain why you need file
binaries from oe-core in the sdk/tarball, instead of relying on file
the host system.

Sdk could be build on different host platforms with slightly different OS versions.
Some binaries could be missing, some have different behavior from version to version.
Hence we prefer to share our own tool set, i.e. buildtools tarball to keep environment consistent.
Another moment that different sdk versions could require different tools and it's easier to
switch link to buildtools tarball then reconfigure build server.

Regards,
Oleksiy

Hi Alexander,

We have submitted the patch[1] which fixes the build for our case but doesn't change the contents of file.sh which is a separate issue.
You suggested changing MAGIC to "\$OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc".
We can also get the same result with "${datadir}/misc/magic.mgc" which is what was used for create_cmdline_wrapper in this recipe.
Which one is preferred?

[1] see "[PATCH] file: return wrapper to fix builds when file is in buildtools-tarball" in openembedded-core

Regards,
Oleksandr

I don't have a preference. If both options work, there's clearly more
sdk relocation magic in various places than I thought was happening,
so I would pick the option that is less likely to quietly regress, but
right now I can't say which one that would be.

Personally, I'd really like to patch libmagic to move the path to it's
own section, then we can use the relocation technique we use with gcc
to change the patch and most of these issues go away...

Cheers,

Richard
