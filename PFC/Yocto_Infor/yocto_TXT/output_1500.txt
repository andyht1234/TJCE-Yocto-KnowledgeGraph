Hello,

Im using the 5.10.100 kernel from the meta-intel layer and have an image that runs most of the df_* demos as well asÂ cinematicexperience Qt5 example without any interference from the console output. I have an application that writes directly to the framebuffer device but gets smothered by text from the console. When I try to unbind the fbcon or disable the cursor I am also prevented from graphics being displayed. If for example i run `cat /dev/urandom > /dev/fb0` i get noise as expected with a small blinking cursor from the terminal, but if i disable the cursor that command does nothing. Any thoughts on how i can display framebuffer graphics without console interference would be much appreciated,

-Doug
