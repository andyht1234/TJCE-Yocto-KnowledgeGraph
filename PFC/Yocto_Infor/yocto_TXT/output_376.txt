I am trying to install opencv by using the meta-oe layer on the kirkstone branch. For that I just added in my recipe INSTALL += "opencv". Building with bitbake runs fine, but when I try to include opencv in cmake with find_package I am struggling with an third-party issue:
/usr/lib/cmake/opencv4/OpenCVModules.cmake:405 (message): The imported target "correspondence" references the file, sysroots/cortexa57-poky-linux/usr/lib/opencv4/3rdparty/libcorrespondence.a"
In my sdk there is actually no 3rdparty directory.
I tried to add some libs like: INSTALL += "opencv libopencv-core libopencv-imgproc" but no success.
If any has an idea what I am doing wrong, that would be cool.. Thanks
