Hello,
I've searched & can't seem to find an answer for this but I'm sure it must
have come up before.

I'd like to automate the generating of images using Bash & create similar
recipes but with different PACKAGECONFIG's. How does one do that?

It would be something like:

#! /bin/bash
source oe-init-build-env build-microchip

# Generate first image
PACKAGECONFIG = "foo"
MACHINE=sama5d4-xplained-sd bitbake microchip-graphics-images
# Upload image to 'cloud'
mv sama5d4-xplained-sd /theCloud

# Generate second image
PACKAGECONFIG = "bar"
MACHINE=sama5d4-xplained-sd bitbake microchip-graphics-images
# Upload image to 'cloud'
mv sama5d4-xplained-sd /theCloud


Thanks,

PACKAGECONFIG is to enable/disable features for a particular software 
package on a per-recipe basis. Hence, by its nature, PACKAGECONFIG is a 
recipe local variable. If you want to set it in a global configuration 
file you need to use the syntax:

PACKAGECONFIG:pn-<recipename> = "feature1 feature3"

if you want to override the entire PACKAGECONFIG variable, or

PACKAGECONFIG:append:pn-<recipename> = "feature4"

if you want to add to the configuration.

For this I would add the specific PACKAGECONFIG to a bitbake pre- or 
post-configuration file and call:

bitbake -r preconf ...

bitbake -R postconf ...
