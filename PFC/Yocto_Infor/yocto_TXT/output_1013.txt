Hello!

I am working with Kirkstone release and need to add java jdk-11.  I have a program which requires it.  When trying to deploy the rpm package I get this error:

nothing provides *java-11-openjdk-devel* needed by ...

How do I get this version of java included with my Yocto image?  Best I can find is using meta-java, which appears to only support up to jdk-8.  I tried including the current meta-java layer and specifying:
IMAGE_INSTALL += " openjdk-11"

That doesn't work.. but it accepts openjdk-8.

Hoping somebody can  help!  Thanks.

David
