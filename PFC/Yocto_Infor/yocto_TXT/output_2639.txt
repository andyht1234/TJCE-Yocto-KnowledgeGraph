Correct.

The rt patches are already integrated on the branches that that recipe will
build out of the linux-yocto repository.

And adding to that, besides the Yocto maintained kernel,  meta-intel
has it's own kernel GIT repo/branch for the kernel and -rt kernel
maintained by Intel.

(There might be some overlap in the maintainers, I am not aware of the
differences between those.).

I used the latter with success on Intel Atom 3950 for hard real-time purposes.

Regards,

Leon.

Right, you can either build linux-yocto-rt or the Intel version with
linux-intel-rt. linux-intel tree might have some platform specific
patches that have either been backported or not upstreamed yet.

The branch & version information is available in the recipe.

Thanks,

Anuj
