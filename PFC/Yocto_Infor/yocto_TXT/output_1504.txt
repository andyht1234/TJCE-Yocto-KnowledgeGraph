Then you need to check the output of 'env'
a) when you start the shell
b) when you use oe-init-build-env
and figure out how the incorrect variable gets into the environment.
Are you using oe-init-build-env from an old yocto?

Hello,

you probably need to exit the shell and then restart it and
re-initialize your environment (with oe-init-build-env), as it
contains the obsolete variable.
