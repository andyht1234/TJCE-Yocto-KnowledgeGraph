Recently I built in base intel NEO driver components under meta-intel...
It appears I require a little more than just NEO.

Does yocto support the khronos icd loader ?,
Is there something I can build/enable tp provide this ?

Currently running under zeus, but if a newer version of Yocto supports it that would be good to know.

Thanks,
Steve
