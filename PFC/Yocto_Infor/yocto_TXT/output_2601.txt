I have a weird thing going on with *__DATE__* and *__TIME__* when building my app in the yocto environment.  I'm building for "genericx86-64" and I'm using __DATE__ and __TIME__ in my source to show what the build date/time of my app is at run time.  But... __DATE__ is always " *Apr  5 2011* " and __TIME__ is always " *23:00:00* ".  And, yes, the current time on the build machine is not that.  Anyone else experience this and/or know how to fix it?  Oh, host is Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.

Mike
