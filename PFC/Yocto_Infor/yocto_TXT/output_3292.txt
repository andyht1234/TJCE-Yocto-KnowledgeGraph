Hi Experts,

I am upgrading my Linux from Yocto Thud to Zeus (5.4 Kernel) . After
building I could see a significant increase in the size of the image.
On checking with buildhistory enabled, I could see that qemu has nearly
doubled in size.

Thud (4.19) - 223084  KiB     qemu
Zeus (5.4) - 474757  KiB     qemu

Is this size increase expected or are there some additional configs that
might have been added as a part of the upgrade ?

Appreciate your help.

TIA,
Aashik

Are you installing qemu into your image though?

Qemu did get larger as it is built with more architectures enabled,
but unless you're installing it in your image it won't make a
difference.

Thanks for the clarification, yes I am installing QEMU in my image. Is
there some way that we can disable the additional architectures and
streamline the size ?

Thanks

Yes, look at the PACKAGECONFIGs and setting QEMU_TARGETS.

Does it mean that with the local.conf line:

# enable,disable,depends,rdepends
#
PACKAGECONFIG[qemu] = "--with-qemu,--without-qemu,qemu,"

The QEMU is completely removed (this is all that needs to be done, or...)?

Thank you,
Zee

Hello Ross,

Thanks ! I was able to reduce the size of the image by modifying the
QEMU_TARGETS variable.. but on enabling buildhistory and checking under
installed-image-sizes.txt , the individual package size of the qemu remains
the same. Is this correct? If not is there any other optimization that can
be done?

Thanks in advance

Aashik
