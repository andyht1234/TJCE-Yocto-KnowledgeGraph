Hello all,
There' a discussion pending on the usage of SRTool and CVE management
for the Yocto project in general. It is related to the need of having
a list of CVEs the project is affected by, those fixed and those that
we know we are not affected.

In the previous episode, we have had a demo of SRTool by David Reyna.
This weekend he has updated the code base. The next call is tomorrow
(Thursday, 19th October, half an hour after the end of the Bug Triage
meeting) to discuss conclusions of first tests and the next steps. If
you are interested to join, let us know!

Kind regards,
Marta
