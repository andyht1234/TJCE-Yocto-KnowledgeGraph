Hello,

I am kinda a noob at this so please bear with me.

I am using the sama5d27-wlsom1-ek board for my demo and I am trying to make
changes to the device tree.

So far I have compiled core-image-minimal and find my dtb files are
generated in
/tmp/work/sama5d27_wlsom1_ek_sd-poky-linux-gnueabi/linux-at91/5.4+gitAUTOINC+3dba8c9991-r0/build/arch/arm/boot/dts
folder.

Also I find many different dts files in
build/tmp/work-shared/sama5d27-wlsom1-ek-sd/kernel-source/arch/arm/boot/dts

But where does my machine get device tree files if they are generated
inside the build folder and if so where do I place my custom files so that
they get called during bitbake.

I want to build the image using my custom dts file where I enable certain
peripherals and disable the ones not required. (A test to update dtb's in
future).

I tried different methods found here
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38917745/quick-rebuild-of-device-tree-only-with-yocto-bitbake

But, I seem to run into some errors when I try to build the image.

Please help and let me know if I missed any required information from my
side.

Thank you and Regards,
Sohil

Hi Sohil,

First make a custom layer for you modifications and add it to bblayers.conf. Then modify your machine definition of KERNEL_DEVICETREE (in meta-yourlayer/conf/machine/machinname.conf) to specify multiple device trees, e.g.

KERNEL_DEVICETREE = "at91-sama5d27_wlsom1_ek.dtb at91-sama5d27_wlsom1_ek_custom.dtb"

Note this should specify the "dtb" (compiled device tree name), not the "dts" (source.)

Next, make a .bbappend for your linux recipe that will provide the .dts source, something like:

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"

SRC_URI += " \
 file://at91-sama5d27_wlsom1_ek_custom.dts;subdir=git/arch/arm/boot/dts \
"

Make a subdirectory with package name (e.g. linux-yocto) and put your dts in there. The "subdir" directive tells bitbake to drop the dts into the appropriate directory for the linux build process to find it. The device tree(s) will be built along with linux and put in the image's /boot directory. You can select which device tree you want to boot with via u-boot, or by manipulating the symbolic links in the /boot directory.

Best wishes,

Rob Calhoun

Hi Robert,

Thank you for your reply.
This works and I got my dtb generated in my build directory!

Best wishes,
Sohil
