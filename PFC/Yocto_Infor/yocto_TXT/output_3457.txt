Hi All,

Did anyone manage to create a recipe for python dlib from the official site https://github.com/davisking/dlib ?
They provide C++ and Python API, (CMakeLists + setup.py). All recipes found for dlib are inheriting cmake for C++.
But when inheriting setuptools3 error occurs.

Thanks,
Talel

Thanks for the suggestion, but they are using the C++ API as well. I already created a recipe for the C++ API of dlib and it is working, the only thing needed is compitling the Python API.
