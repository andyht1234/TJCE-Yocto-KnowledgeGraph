Hi,

We set the BUILDNAME (via local.conf) variable to the output of "git
describe --long --always" so this info ends up in /etc/version instead
of a date. (i.e to know the exact source version of the code
deployed on a target)

This has worked fine for us up until 3.1.12, but now we just get a
date (201803...) in /etc/version.

Note that since switching to Dunfell we were forced to set
BUILD_REPRODUCIBLE_BINARIES to 0, so the build system would not "mess
up" /etc/version, but not even that helps now.

What's the official way to get something more useful than a date (in
the long past) in /etc/version?

Thanks,
 Henrik

We use build image-buildinfo class:
https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#ref-classes-image-buildinfo

Just add INHERIT += "image-buildinfo" to your local.conf to get the build info.

After doing a bit of bisecting it appears that this commit is the culprit:

reproducible_build: Remove BUILD_REPRODUCIBLE_BINARIES checking
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/?h=dunfell&id=0d6ebaf8ff3232248ebf0e859cd09aefaee54a8a

Since this was cherry-picked from master to fix some reproducibililty
errors I suspected that the issue might also exist in the master
branch.

A quick test with:

BUILD_REPRODUCIBLE_BINARIES = "0"
BUILDNAME = "my custom name"

added to local.conf confirmed that /etc/version was indeed
"20180309123456" instead of the expected "my custom name"

I'm out of time to work on this today, but perhaps Richard might have
some ideas on how to address this.

rootfs-postcommands.bbclass says:

# Perform any additional adjustments needed to make rootf binary reproducible
rootfs_reproducible () {
        if [ "${REPRODUCIBLE_TIMESTAMP_ROOTFS}" != "" ]; then
                # Convert UTC into %4Y%2m%2d%2H%2M%2S
                sformatted=`date -u -d @${REPRODUCIBLE_TIMESTAMP_ROOTFS} +%4Y%2m%2d%2H%2M%2S`
                echo $sformatted > ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/etc/version
                bbnote "rootfs_reproducible: set /etc/version to $sformatted"

                if [ -d ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}${sysconfdir}/gconf ]; then
                        find ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}${sysconfdir}/gconf -name '%gconf.xml' -print0 | xargs -0r \
                        sed -i -e 's@\bmtime="[0-9][0-9]*"@mtime="'${REPRODUCIBLE_TIMESTAMP_ROOTFS}'"@g'
                fi
        fi
}

so I'd try setting REPRODUCIBLE_TIMESTAMP_ROOTFS to "". I suspect the change
above started setting that to some value incidentally.

Cheers,

Richard

confirmed by commenting out the echo above that that "solves the
issue", so it's in fact this code that is now wrongfully triggered.

I think Richard was suggesting that you add
REPRODUCIBLE_TIMESTAMP_ROOTFS to "" to your local.conf.

I did so and confirmed that /etc/version now has BUILDNAME for its
contents as expected.

Richard is correct that the patch was setting
REPRODUCIBLE_TIMESTAMP_ROOTFS incidentally.  This part of Mark's patch
seems to be the cause:

-inherit ${@oe.utils.ifelse(d.getVar('BUILD_REPRODUCIBLE_BINARIES') ==
'1', 'reproducible_build_simple', '')}
+inherit reproducible_build_simple

And reproducible_build_simple does:

BUILD_REPRODUCIBLE_BINARIES = "1"

export PYTHONHASHSEED = "0"
export PERL_HASH_SEED = "0"
export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH ??= "1520598896"

REPRODUCIBLE_TIMESTAMP_ROOTFS ??= "1520598896"

So it is now overwriting what you've set in local.conf for
BUILD_REPRODUCIBLE_BINARIES. And if you look at your rootfs, you'll
probably see that all of the files are dated March 2019.

Master branch has restructured the code, but retained this behavior.

I'm not sure what the right answer is for dealing with the BUILDNAME
issue.  Richard and Mark understand the reproducible build code far
better than I,  perhaps they can offer an opinion on what to do here.

Steve
