Hi,

I'm using the provided local.conf from the BSP which contains:

DISTRO_FEATURES_remove = " x11"

but I need to install xrandr in my image which needs x11, i.e. I set

DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " x11"
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " xrandr"

in my custom recipe. However, upon building, I get the following error:

ERROR: Nothing RPROVIDES 'xrandr' (but 
/home/yocto/rzg_vlp_v3.0.0/build/../meta-mistysom/recipes-core/images/mistysom-image.bb 
RDEPENDS on or otherwise requires it)
xrandr was skipped: missing required distro feature 'x11' (not in 
DISTRO_FEATURES)
NOTE: Runtime target 'xrandr' is unbuildable, removing...
Missing or unbuildable dependency chain was: ['xrandr']
ERROR: Required build target 'mistysom-image' has no buildable providers.
Missing or unbuildable dependency chain was: ['mistysom-image', 'xrandr']

Can I override the setting in locl.conf from my custom recipe? How?

Ron

You can't. '_remove' has priority over everything else, and
DISTRO_FEATURES cannot be set from a recipe, only from a global
config. You should edit local.conf, and complain to your BSP provider
for using _remove instead of a direct assignment.

Although, as soon as I added

DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " x11"

to local.conf, I'm not able to build anymore but see an error like below 
instead:

I've Googled around but nbot been able to find a work around.

Hello,

once we run into a similar issue with the xserver xorg v1.20.8 compilation, in
our case, the gbm (libgles) from the BSP provider was in version `r8p0` and not
`10.2.0`, which is required by xserver xorg. To solve this, we added a simple
patch to `configure.ac` of xserver xorg to change dependency from
`LIBGBM="gbm >= 10.2.0"` to `LIBGBM="gbm >= r8p0"` which allowed us to resolve
the compilation error and built the package. Later we did not see any
significant performance issues, so we went with that solution.

Regards
