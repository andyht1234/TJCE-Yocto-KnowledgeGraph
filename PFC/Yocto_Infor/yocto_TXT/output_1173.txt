Hi,

After some questions on this mailing list, we got comments on our usage of
quite an old yocto poky version: sumo.

What are the steps to upgrade to a newer version?
We have quite some of our own recipes, and also some proprietary third
party patches.

Do we go version by version from sumo to the most recent one, or big bang?
Are there tools to for example fix and replace the old notation by the new
one?
Any other tips?

Kind regards,

Maik Vermeulen

There is extensive documentation about moving between releases here
with our migration guides between each version:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/migration-guides/index.html

That will include information about the migration tools where
available.

Personally, I'd probably try working with the last release or last LTS
and then try and get everything you need working with that rather than
doing it incrementally but a lot depends on your experience/needs and
the kinds of changes you have.

Cheers,

Richard

Marta is giving a talk tomorrow at the Yocto Project Summit that might 
have some more ideas for you to consider:
