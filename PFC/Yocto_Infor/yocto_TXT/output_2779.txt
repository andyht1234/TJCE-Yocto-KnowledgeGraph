Hi Armin

Support for RRECOMMENDS in the PACKAGECONFIG was added some years 
ago[1][2]. Whatever they should be RRECOMMENDS or RDEPENDS I'm not sure 
about (I don't think swtpm-create-tpmca is a hard requirement for most 
people).

If you like I can squash the changes into my own patch and resend it.

Cheers,
Kristian
