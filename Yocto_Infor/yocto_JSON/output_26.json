We have merged a workaround which seems to fix things for the\n   majority of cases. There is also a second proposed patch from upstream\n   which may help. The dilemma is which option to go for in the release and\n   the time implications of the choice as one is tested and one is not.\n   -\n\n   The only other potential issue for 4.3 is the strace ptest image space\n   issues which is still being worked on.\n   -\n\n   Patchtest did merge to OE-Core and will be included in the release\n   allowing users to locally test their patches before submission using the\n   same code/tests we will ultimately run against mailing list submissions.\n   This is late in the cycle but important to help users and standalone code\n   so worthwhile adding since it was ready. Thanks Trevor!\n   -\n\n   There were multiple CVE fixes merged over the last week to ensure the\n   release had recent widely publicized CVEs addressed.\n   -\n\n   Toaster has had upgrades to key components which help address security\n   issues and patches are merging to enable testing to be resumed and\n   ultimately, automated.\n   -\n\n   There was a big improvement in reproducibility for rust. Unfortunately\n   this hasn’t addressed all the issues but is a big step forward and great to\n   see progress on what was a really difficult to track down issue, thanks\n   Sundeep.\n   -\n\n   The project is pleased to have a new content delivery network (CDN)\n   available to share sstate from the autobuilder with. See the entry in\n   local.conf.sample on how to use it.\n   -\n\n   After consultation and discussions the project is now about to document\n   its security processes to complete the work in this area. Please watch the\n   mailing lists such as the architecture list if you have an interest in this\n   area.\n\n\nWays to contribute:\n\n   -\n\n   As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which\n   are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to\n   keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool,\n   toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many\n   have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these\n   components!\n   -\n\n   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:\n   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers\n   -\n\n   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:\n   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs\n   -\n\n   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list\n   at:\n   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc\n   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing\n   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help\n   facilitate this.\n   -\n\n   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder\n   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to\n   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:\n   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.\n   -\n\n   Help us resolve CVE issues: CVE metrics\n   <https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/patchmetrics/>\n   -\n\n   We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is\n   appreciated.\n\n\nYP 4.3 Milestone Dates:\n\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3 M3 was released.\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3 M4 build date  2023/10/02\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3 M4 Release date 2023/10/27\n\n\nYP 5.0 Milestone Dates:\n\n   -\n\n   YP 5.0 M1 build date 2023/12/04\n   -\n\n   YP 5.0 M1 Release date 2023/12/15\n   -\n\n   YP 5.0 M2 build date  2024/01/15\n   -\n\n   YP 5.0 M2 Release date 2024/01/24\n   -\n\n   YP 5.0 M3 build date  2024/02/19\n   -\n\n   YP 5.0 M3 Release date 2024/03/01\n   -\n\n   YP 5.0 M4 build date  2024/04/01\n   -\n\n   YP 5.0 M4 Release date 2024/04/30\n\n\nUpcoming dot releases:\n\n   -\n\n   YP 3.1.29 build date 2023/10/30\n   -\n\n   YP 3.1.29 Release date 2023/11/10\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.14 build date 2023/11/06\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.14 Release date 2023/11/17\n   -\n\n   YP 4.2.4 build date 2023/11/13\n   -\n\n   YP 4.2.4 Release date 2023/11/24\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3.1 build date 2023/11/27\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3.1 Release date 2023/12/08\n   -\n\n   YP 3.1.30 build date 2023/12/11\n   -\n\n   YP 3.1.30 Release date 2023/12/22\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.15 build date 2023/12/18\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.15 Release date 2023/12/29\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3.2 build date 2024/01/08\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3.2 Release date 2024/01/19\n   -\n\n   YP 3.1.31 build date 2024/01/22\n   -\n\n   YP 3.1.31 Release date 2024/02/02\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.16 build date 2024/01/29\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.16 Release date 2024/02/09\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3.3 build date 2024/02/12\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3.3 Release date 2024/02/23\n   -\n\n   YP 3.1.32 build date 2024/03/04\n   -\n\n   YP 3.1.32 Release date 2024/03/15\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.17 build date 2024/03/11\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.17 Release date 2024/03/22\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3.4 build date 2024/03/25\n   -\n\n   YP 4.3.4 Release date 2024/04/05\n   -\n\n   YP 3.1.33 build date 2024/04/15\n   -\n\n   YP 3.1.33 Release date 2024/04/26\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.18 build date 2024/04/22\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.18 Release date 2024/05/03\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.19 build date 2024/06/03\n   -\n\n   YP 4.0.19 Release date 2024/06/14\n\n\nTracking Metrics:\n\n   -\n\n   WDD 2478 (last week 2450) (\n   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/charts/combo.html)\n   -\n\n   OE-Core/Poky Patch Metrics\n   -\n\n      Total patches found: 1176 (last week 1176)\n      -\n\n      Patches in the Pending State: 254 (21%) [last week 254 (21%)]\n      -\n\n   https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/patchmetrics/\n\n\nThe Yocto Project’s technical governance is through its Technical Steering\nCommittee, more information is available at:\n\nhttps://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/TSC\n\nThe Status reports are now stored on the wiki at:\nhttps://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Weekly_Status\n\n[If anyone has suggestions for other information you’d like to see on this\nweekly status update, let us know!]\n\n\n*Neal Caidin*\nProgram Manager\nThe Linux Foundation\nDurham, NC, U.S.A. - Eastern time zone\n+1 (919) 238-9104 (w/h)\n+1 (919) 949-1861 (m)\nncaidin@linuxfoundation.org\n\n[-- Attachment #2: Type: text/html, Size: 52772 bytes --]\n\n^ permalink raw reply\t[flat|nested] only message in thread",
