The host distro doesn’t match and this matters for some of the tests, as some distros don’t support some of the selftests. In this case specifically, there are seven regressions and six of them are specific to the host changing, which has the side-effect of hiding the one actual regression.\n> \n> Yeah, that's a point I have been struggling with when starting to update those\n> tools.

That is hard in code\nthough whilst keeping it generic.\n\nCheers,\n\nRichard\n\n\n^ permalink raw reply\t[flat|nested] 11+ messages in thread",

Given the build failure in the rc1 build and\nother security issues we're thinking we should make an rc2 build and\nabandon rc1.\n\nSorry for the churn. The new build should be ready soon with any luck.\n\nCheers,\n\nRichard\n\n\n\n^ permalink raw reply\t[flat|nested] 11+ messages in thread",
