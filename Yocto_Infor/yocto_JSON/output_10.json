    "* volatile-binds overlays with selinux\n@ 2023-10-20 12:59 Sebastien FABRE\n  0 siblings, 0 replies; only message in thread\nFrom: Sebastien FABRE @ 2023-10-20 12:59 UTC (permalink / raw)\n  To: yocto\n\nHello,\n\nI am trying to use selinux (refpolicy-targeted) in read-only root filesystem with kirkstone. Volatile-binds recipe create overlays, but we have multiple selinux denied logs (even with allow_mount_anyfile boolean set to on).\nMost of them are because scontext is \"system_u:system_r:mount_t:s0\". In the following example, it should be systemd_tmpfiles_t:\naudit[240]: AVC avc:  denied  { relabelfrom } for  pid=240 comm=\"systemd-tmpfile\" name=\"dbus\" dev=\"tmpfs\" ino=31 scontext=system_u:system_r:mount_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:system_dbusd_var_lib_t:s0 tclass=dir permissive=1\n\n\"rootcontext\" mount option (added by https://github.com/yoctoproject/poky/commit/e325390b91da7d3b43e78ad840a9fe5cd14a9ab7) seems to not have impact.\n\nIf volatile-binds variable \"AVOID_OVERLAYFS\" is equal to 1 (bind is used instead of overlay), we do not have these errors.\nIn read-write rootfs, we seem to have the same behavior with overlays (scontext equal to mount_t).\n\nI see that some options have been added in the mount-copybind script for selinux support, but I got denials. What is missing to not have these denied logs?\n\nBest regards,\nSebastien\n\n\n^ permalink raw reply\t[flat|nested] only message in thread",
