Hi

" It is over. There are no excuses left if you are still using meta-gplv2."
-- https://twitter.com/yoctoproject/status/1552209990148145153
" There are other ways of removing GPLv3 components from modern OE/YP builds and we'd like to focus people's attention onto those. "
-- https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-gplv2/commit/?id=43bf0e8d5985945d19d01f94bfbbda420c4435f3

Where can we find more details re the best ways of removing GPLv3 components please?

Or, starting with a clean slate and adding back only what we actually need (for i.MX 8X and Qt Commercial).

Have tried searching, but going round in circles, as all the results so far still point back to meta-gplv2.
Including the "How do I":
"If you use INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE to exclude GPLv3 or set PREFERRED_VERSION to substitute a GPLv2 version of a GPLv3 recipe, then you must add the meta-gplv2 layer to your configuration."
-- https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/How_do_I#Q:_How_do_I_build_an_image_without_GPLv3_Licensed_packages_.3F

The context is that some of our customers require Secure Boot and Chain of Trust (in an embedded environment).
If we keep GPLv3 components, then we need to provide "any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work".

Thank you
-- Peter

The suggested way nowadays is to set INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE only for the
image that is actually going to ship in a product, then work your way
throgh specific gpl3 dependencies that get pulled in, and eliminate
them one by one - precisely how is impossible to tell beforehands, but
typical problems are bash scripts (which you need to package
separately and not include into the product, or rewrite in posix shell
and use #!/bin/sh), or optional dependencies on things like readline,
which can be switched off via PACKAGECONFIG tweaks.

Thanks for raising this question, and thanks to Alex for providing 
guidelines.

I agree that the current wiki and documentation don't provide enough 
information on excluding GPLv3 packages. I'll propose an update to the 
manuals. Stay tuned on the docs mailing lists...

Cheers
Michael.

For what it's worth, I have eliminated meta-gplv2 from the
infotainment stack (e.g. a major build) of a major car OEM, so this is
doable. It would help if you bring up specific issues that you see and
we try to figure out how to solve them, and come up with a list of
'standard practices'. Even bash has a sort-of replacement in busybox,
which needs to be enabled and played with.

Oh and: anywhere where INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE is mentioned in the docs,
it must be adjusted to stress that per-image variant of it is a far
better option than a global ban. Also further instructions and
pointers, e.g. to the tests we have which can serve as a starting
point:
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/tree/meta/lib/oeqa/selftest/cases/incompatible_lic.py#n100

Hi Alex and Michael

Thank you very much, that worked for core-image-minimal and core-image-weston, with kirkstone-4.0.4

For core-image-weston, copying the "Settings for weston" from incompatible_lic.py#n149 ( https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/tree/meta/lib/oeqa/selftest/cases/incompatible_lic.py#n149 ) works.
And core-image-minimal works automatically with just INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE:pn-core-image-minimal = "GPL-3.0* LGPL-3.0* AGPL-3.0*"

Whereas, the global ban produced errors e.g.:
INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE = "GPL-3.0* LGPL-3.0* AGPL-3.0*"
...
ERROR: Nothing RPROVIDES 'bash' (but /workdir/poky/poky/meta/recipes-devtools/opkg-utils/opkg-utils_0.5.0.bb, /workdir/poky/poky/meta/recipes-devtools/python/python3_3.10.4.bb RDEPENDS on or otherwise requires it)
Missing or unbuildable dependency chain was: ['core-image-minimal', 'packagegroup-core-boot', 'update-alternatives-opkg', 'bash']

However, the documentation recommends the global ban and does not mention the per-image variant?
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/images.html
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE

Out of curiosity, why does the per image variant work, but not the global ban?
And how should one know to use the pn- prefix? i.e.
this: INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE:pn-core-image-minimal
not this: INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE:core-image-minimal?

Thank you
-- Peter

Yes, someone should go over the documentation and change every mention
of this to recommend per-image variant, as a global one is basically
impossible to use without pulling in meta-gpl2. Patches welcome :)

> Out of curiosity, why does the per image variant work, but not the global ban?

Global ban works at the task dependency creation stage, and if bash
needs to be built, it will throw an error, even if the actual bash
binary will not end up in the image, and is only used as a runtime
dependency for a package that won't be installed.
Per-image ban performs a 'late' check when the image is actually put together.

You should now know everything to fix the docs ;-)

> And how should one know to use the pn- prefix? i.e.

pn- means 'applies only to this recipe'. The package vs recipe
terminology is confusing here for historical reasons.

Thanks! I should be able to send a patch this week.
