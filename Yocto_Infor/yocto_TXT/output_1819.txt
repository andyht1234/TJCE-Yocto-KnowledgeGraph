Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.4.4 released
*	YP 4.0.1 was built and is in QA
*	We're coming up to 4.1 M1 at the end of the month which is a good
point to aim for early testing of changes in the next release.
*	There are some prototype scripts updating patchwork patch status for
OpenEmbedded-Core and BitBake which is covering about 75% of the patches to
the merged state along with revision information:
<https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/project/oe-core/list/>
https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/project/oe-core/list/

We're hoping to extend this to other status information such as in
master-next for testing but it is a work in progress. Let us know if you
find this useful. With some manual work to clear the backlog of patches we
could aim to keep it more up to date (there is an archive status we could
use for that too).

*	We have added a new "metrics" target on the autobuilder. This
currently has some simple patch status tracking information and can generate
a history graph but the hope is to extend this to CVE metrics and likely
other things. If anyone has interest in helping here, please let Richard
know.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
