Key Status/Updates:

*	4.1 M3 rc2 is in QA
*	4.1 M3 rc1 was abandoned after it failed to build due to a number of
intermittent issues including:

*	virtio block device issues in qemu we're hoping are fixed in qemu
7.1.0
*	debuginfod host contamination
*	recurrence of the libgcrypt ptest issues
*	problems with the fetcher race fix

            Thanks to everyone who helped debug and/or fix these.

*	Builds are now running more reliably on the autobuilder but we're
still seeing some timeout issues
*	CVE counts are high on all branches at present. Steve Sakoman has
kindly put some encouragement in place for those helping dunfell with CVE
issues, see the mailing list for details.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
