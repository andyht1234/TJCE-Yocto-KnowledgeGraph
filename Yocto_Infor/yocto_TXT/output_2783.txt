Dear Team,
I'm using poky-hardknotte for building the image for rpi4, here my need is to add one desktop and a Firefox browser with it,
I built xfce desktop and it's working fine, but when I'm adding Firefox browser with it's getting segmentation fault when executing it from terminal, and from desktop menu it's responding anything may be back end it's getting same segmentation fault,
please give me some hint so that I can conclude my task.

Thanks & Regards.
