I did find the location of the bbapppends:

$ bitbake-layers show-appends | grep boot
u-boot_2021.10.bb:
/home/yocto/rzv_vlp_v3.0.0/build/../meta-renesas/recipes-rzg2l/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot_2021.10.bbappend 

u-boot_2021.10.bb (skipped):
/home/yocto/rzv_vlp_v3.0.0/build/../meta-renesas/recipes-rzg2l/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot_2021.10.bbappend

but searching in 
/home/yocto/rzv_vlp_v3.0.0/build/../meta-renesas/recipes-rzg2l/recipes-bsp/u-boot/ 
for "*config*" did not yield any results.

.config should be in build tree of u-boot, when you do bitbake u-boot,
please look into the builddir of u-boot under work folder
