I add these lines in a bbappend file:
addhandler cjltest
cjltest[eventmask] = "bb.event.BuildStarted"
python cjltest () {
    bb.warn("enter my event code")
}

But when bitbake this recipe, no warning message appears.

BuildStarted is a global event like configParsed, it's not fired for each
individual recipe that's parsed. You can include a .inc that does it from a
global config file, or create a bbclass that you add to INHERIT in a global
config file.
