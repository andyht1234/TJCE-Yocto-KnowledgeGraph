The recipe is failing during do_compile(), which is a hint that you need a
-native recipe, not target recipe.
DEPENDS += "python3-wheel-native"

After that it will throw the 'already-stripped' QA Error:
# ERROR: pyinstaller-4.5.1-r0 do_package: QA Issue: File
'/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/PyInstaller/bootloader/Linux-64bit-intel/run'
from pyinstaller was already stripped, this will prevent future debugging!
[already-stripped]
# ERROR: pyinstaller-4.5.1-r0 do_package: QA Issue: File
'/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/PyInstaller/bootloader/Linux-64bit-intel/run_d'
from pyinstaller was already stripped, this will prevent future debugging!
[already-stripped]

The fix for that is:
INSANE_SKIP:${PN} += "already-stripped"

But pyinstaller is a complicated program and has many more dependencies for
run time (RDEPENDS). One way to help figure those out is to use 'devtool
add' to create the original recipe.

$ devtool add python3-pyinstaller
https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a9/d9/9fdfb0ac2354d059e466d562689dbe53a23c4062019da2057f0eaed635e0/pyinstaller-4.5.1.tar.gz
(we use Debian naming, so prefix the pypi name with python3-, the URL is
from pypi 'Download FIles' )

In this case it resulted in a recipe with a parsing error, but normally
this doesn't happen. Devtool detected a lot of dependencies, including two
recipes that are not in YP/OE yet.

I have created a WIP branch you can try to use moving forward, but you'll
have to do the rest of the work yourself or with the help of the community.

If you desire the functionality of UPX, there is a recipe in
meta-virtualization
