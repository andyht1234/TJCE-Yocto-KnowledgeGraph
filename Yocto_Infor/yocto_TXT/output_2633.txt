Looking for the proper Yocto way to handle third party software ported to Yocto and built into kernel...

I'm not having issues when I recognize the license as a generic license. But the license provided to us by the vendor is not part of the generic licenses list that you (Yocto) recognize.

I was wondering if you could explain how to add a custom license to a recipe in yocto.

The vendor has provided us with a generic license.txt file and I was able to add that to the our recipe. I do get a warning though which says:

WARNING: aiox-defaultfs-1.0-r0 do_rootfs: The license listed DataDeviceCorporation was not in the licenses collected for recipe acexpci

Though the warning occurs, I can see the license.txt being saved inside the rootfs on our board and is saved under tmp/deploy/licenses/acexpci. I've been trying to get rid of this warning when the image builds, but I can't seem to find anything in the manual or online. One solution says : Add LICENSE_PATH += "${LAYERDIR}/custom-licenses" under conf/layer.conf, which does not resolve this warning.

I am currently building with Yocto zeus...

Thanks,
Steve
