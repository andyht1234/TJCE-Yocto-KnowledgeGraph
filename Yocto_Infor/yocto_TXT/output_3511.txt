To my way of thinking, a

$ devtool modify linux

should NEVER fail if it is preceded by

$ bitbake -c do_cleanall linux

The intended staging of the kernel into the workspace fails, saying
that it cannot find miscellaneous and adhoc .scc files that no longer
exist after several variants of kernel config modifications.

fails on do_kernel_metadata...

| ERROR. input file "cfg/xilinx_intc.scc" does not exist

How to fix???
