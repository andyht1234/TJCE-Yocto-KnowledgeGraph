Hi,

I've just upgraded from Zeus to Hardknott with the kernel 5.10.59, the
/run/log/journal was running out of space and crashed, is it a kernel
issue or Hardknott build issue?

I never seen that issue in Zeus, I thought that systemd-journald
should be capable of detecting the space, if it is no log space, stop
writing rather crashing the tmpfs

[13749.397288] systemd-journald[97]: Failed to open runtime journal:
No space left on device
[13749.439047] systemd-journald[97]: File
/run/log/journal/4ba2cd613d004916863e30730800bb69/system.journal
corrupted or uncleanly shut down, renaming and replacing.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

- jh

Hello Jupiter,

This might provide you a great help:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/864722/where-is-journalctl-data-stored

Namely:





*Usually the storage directory is /var/log/journal or /run/log/journal, but
it doesn't have to necessarily exist in your system.If you just want to
check the amount of space that the journal is currently occupying on your
disk, simply type:$ journalctl --disk-usage*

You also can combine the df command (look into man df).
