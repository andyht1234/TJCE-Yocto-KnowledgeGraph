Hi All,

I'm learning Yocto after spending some time with Buildroot. One of the
things I like to do is to use xconfig instead of menuconfig for configuring
things like kernels, u-boot, etc as it's easier to search and navigate in
there. Yocto came with *do_menuconfig* so I tried to adapt it to use
xconfig.

*do_menuconfig*(defined in in cml1.bbclass) has *KCONFIG_CONFIG_COMMAND* to
select which make target to use so the first thing I did was change the
value from "menuconfig" to "xconfig". This didn't work since pkg-config has
problems finding the Qt package when running make xconfig. I then add the
meta-qt5 layer as well as adding some dependencies to do_menuconfig:

do_menuconfig[depends] += "qtbase-native:do_populate_sysroot"
do_menuconfig[depends] += "nativesdk-qtbase:do_populate_sysroot"

This didn't work as pkg-config still has problems finding the Qt. I checked
*do_menuconfig*'s log and the only thing pkg-config seems to be able to
find is gtk-docs. This is where I'm currently stumped, any help would be
appreciated. Thank you for your time.
