We have an issue with a custom recipe which includes a pre-build
binary. Before migrating to Kirkstone 4.0.1 we were able to build the
recipe using >INSANE_SKIP:${PN} += "already-stripped"<, but this now
failed with:

ERROR: intel-docker-compose-2.2.2-r0 do_package: QA Issue: File
'/usr/bin/docker-compose' from intel-docker-compose was already
stripped, this will prevent future debugging! [already-stripped]
