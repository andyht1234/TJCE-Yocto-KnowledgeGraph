Hello:

Is there a package I can install under Yocto so that scripts can perform bitwise functions, to help with converting the read hex data into the correct unit of measurement, i.e. mV, watts, etc. ?

Thanks,
Steve

Hi Steve,

You can do bitwise operations with standard C library and no additional package needed.
Is there any limitation for your data reading? Could you describe more in detail?

Regards,
Duy
