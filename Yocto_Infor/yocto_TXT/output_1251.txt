Hi everyone,

I'm wondering how to figure out the scope of a set of parameters.  Example.  I have an Image (my-core-image-minimal.bb) recipe containing the following parameters

> IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE_append = "${@bb.utils.contains(" DISTRO_FEATURES ",

SystemD isn't deployed in my image as the init_manager.  Now, I put the parameters into local.conf

It works!!!!

I'm confused because my comprehension is when I run bitbake my-core-image-minimal , the parameters defined in this image are defined at the top level of the bitbake configuration parameters no?

Seriously, I have a lots of difficulties understanding the scope of a parameter, where to put it.  At the limit, my comprehension is that I can have two recipes:

* my-core-image-minimal-sysvinit.bb
* my-core-image-minimal-systemd.bb

The systemd one define the systemd parameters, the sysvinit doesn't implement anything else.

What does I miss?

Thank you all :)
Martin

Hi Martin,

its Yocto chant #1: "Recipe data is local, configuration data is global."

Means: whatever happens in a recipe, other recipes can't see it. Whatever
happens in a configuration file (local, machine, distro), it is visible
everywhere. An image is just a recipe, in the end - so whatever you do
there, it cannot affect the distribution. In a nutshell: you can't set
DISTRO_FEATURES in an image.

Re-adding list, as I think this is valid information for all Yocto users.

No, thats not how it works. Its like this:
- if the variable is supposed to only have an effect within the very bb
file that you are looking at then it can stay in the recipe
- if the variable is supposed to affect something else, it needs to go into
a configuration file.

This is is not tied to specific variable names or such. It is purely about
the visibility.

Greetz,
Josef

Again re-adding list....

I encourage you to look at and understand the evaluation for yourself by
issuing "bitbake-getvar -r core-image-minimal IMAGE_INSTALL"
