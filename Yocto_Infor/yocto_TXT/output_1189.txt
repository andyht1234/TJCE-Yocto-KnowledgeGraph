Greetings !

Can any one help me out to include "realm" (used as command line tool that can be used for management of enrollment in Kerberos realms, like Active Directory domains ) in Yocto (Zeus).

Thanks,

always look into layerindex for available packages. A search for
realmd reveals that there is no recipe for it. So you have to write
one

https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/recipes/?q=+realmd

something like this might be a good start
