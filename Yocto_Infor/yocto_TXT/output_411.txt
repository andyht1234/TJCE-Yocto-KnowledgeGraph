Hi,
A bug is triggered when using docker + Ubuntu 20.04. 3 LTS. The bug message is :

File: 'xxx/build/poky/meta/classes/kernel-module-split.bbclass', lineno: 68, function: extract_modinfo
0064:                raise msg
0065:            cmd = "%sobjcopy -j .modinfo -O binary %s %s" % (d.getVar("HOST_PREFIX") or "", tmpkofile, tmpfile)
0066:        else:
0067:            cmd = "%sobjcopy -j .modinfo -O binary %s %s" % (d.getVar("HOST_PREFIX") or "", file, tmpfile)
*** 0068:        subprocess.check_call(cmd, shell=True)
Exception: subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'aarch64-poky-linux-objcopy -j .modinfo -O binary ../keymaps/rc-alink-dtu-m.ko   ../tmpwhs5uwlt' returned non-zero exit status 1.

The  " rc-alink-dtu-m.ko " file is damaged, and can't  analysis by file command :
$ file -b rc-alink-dtu-m.ko
data
and the damaged is caused by  build/poky/meta/classes/package.bbclass  perform_packagecopy()
cmd = 'tar --exclude=./sysroot-only -cf - -C %s -p -S . | tar -xf - -C %s' % (dest, dvar)

remove the "-S " can fix the bug.
notes: this bug only appears in Ubuntu 20.04. 3 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.04. 6 LTS do not have the issue.

Do you have the tar versions for the two distro versions? Was this a
bug that was fixed in tar?

I'm not sure we can easily work around this, it may be better to error
if a build is attempted with a known broken tar version?

Cheers,

Richard

Hi Richard,

tar --version

both of the two distro are the same.

That is rather unfortunate as we can't tell them apart :( I'm not sure
what we can do about this other than warn that 20.04.3 isn't supported
and/or has a bug?

Cheers,

Richard

Hi Richard,
How about to remove "-S" in the tar commands ?
I only tested 20.04.3 and 20.04.6. I didn't test the other distro, so I'm not sure if there's anything wrong with the other distro.
To be on the safe side, remove the "-S" can solve the problem fundamentally.

This would make the archives not use sparse optimization and increase
the size of resulting archives. I think it will
penalize all other hosts. I would just suggest calling out a
workaround for a particular version of distro where it's problematic
and move on. anyway 20.04 LTS is already at 20.04.6 at the moment.
