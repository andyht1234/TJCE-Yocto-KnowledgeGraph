Is the sstate cache sensitive to different releases and or the ordering of
the bblayers?   We are upgrading our Yocto-based distro from dunfell to
hardknott.  So for a while we will be building our distro on both releases.
  Do we need to keep the sstate caches separate for these builds?

Another related question... Does changing the order of the bblayers corrupt
the sstate cache (ie require a fresh sstate)?
Thanks

No and no.

Alex is very much correct, you should not see corruption. But I think more
detail is in order.

If your distro repository is a "garden variety" set of image recipes and
recipe overrides that pull upstream source bundles, then your SSTATE cache
should age nicely from release to release.

However, if your source code and associated application files ride along in
the same repository as your recipes, or you add your own bbclass
functionality, you may want to reconsider keeping SSTATE cache around for
too long. There are still some issues to be worked out to make the local
file fetcher as reliable as the other fetchers when it comes to keeping
your distro buttoned up into one monolithic repository with application
level source code trees.

Did we get that solved on master or not? I can't remember if there were
remaining issues or not?

Cheers,

Richard
