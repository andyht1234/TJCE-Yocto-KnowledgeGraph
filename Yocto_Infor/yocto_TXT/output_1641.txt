Hi,

Does yocto store all packages name that will be built from a recipe in a variable?

BR,
Simon

Bitbake -g recipe

Might emit what you want in some form

That *will* be built, no.

PACKAGES contains the packages which *can* be built, but also the do_package can create more.  For example, it’s possible for a package which builds 20 plugins to dynamically create a package-per-plugin instead of the list being hardcoded.

If you want to know what packages a recipe created then you can use pkgdata.  There is a tool to examine it:

$ oe-pkgdata-util list-pkgs —recipe glibc
glibc
glibc-dbg
glibc-dev
glibc-doc
glibc-extra-nss
glibc-pcprofile
glibc-src
glibc-staticdev
glibc-thread-db
glibc-utils
ldconfig
ldd
ldso
libmemusage
libnss-db
libsotruss
malloc-debug
nscd
sln
tzcode

this is nice. I mistook it for the dependencies
