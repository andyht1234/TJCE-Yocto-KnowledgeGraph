Hello all,

I'm building my project for qemux86-64 and Raspberry Pi 4. Currently, when booted, it displays a textual root shell. I can work with it in both qemu and Raspi and all is good. Now I want to change my image to display a graphical terminal when booted.

On qemu, this already works. In Raspberry Pi, not yet. It still provides me the textual root shell.

On Raspberry Pi, `/var/log/Xorg.0.log` contains the following:
```
[  1049.676] (II) LoadModule: "fbdev"
[  1049.681] (WW) Warning, couldn't open module fbdev
[  1049.681] (EE) Failed to load module "fbdev" (module does not exist, 0)
[  1049.681] (II) modesetting: Driver for Modesetting Kernel Drivers: kms
[  1049.684] (WW) Falling back to old probe method for modesetting
[  1049.684] (EE) open /dev/dri/card0: No such file or directory
[  1049.684] (WW) Falling back to old probe method for modesetting
[  1049.684] (EE) open /dev/dri/card0: No such file or directory
[  1049.684] (EE) No devices detected.
```

`/dev/fb0` does exist, so something like a framebuffer does at least seem to exist.

So how can I install the fbdev module on my Raspberry Pi? I looked around a bit and found this: https://elinux.org/RPi_Xorg_rpi_Driver I tried it out and installed the `/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/fbdev_drv.so` file provided in the page, but it's 32bit armhf architecture. My Raspi image is built for aarch64 architecture, so it naturally doesn't run there.

I googled a bit and there seem to be quite a few technologies around to hw-accelerate output rendering. Read about EGL, GLX, OpenGL and DRI. Are some of these options available on RasperryPi or qemux86_64? I runqemu with the kvm option. Booting is fast, but the GUI terminal window doesn't even catch the keypresses in time.

My image is a core-image-minimal with IMAGE_FEATURES x11-base. (https://gitlab.com/manuel_wagesreither/bora-proj/-/blob/master/meta-manwag/recipes-core/images/bora-image.bb)

The distro is a modified Poky with DISTRO_FEATURES x11. (https://gitlab.com/manuel_wagesreither/bora-proj/-/blob/master/meta-manwag/conf/distro/bora-device.conf) To work around https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi/issues/228 I made DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " opengl".

Thank you all for your input!

Manuel
