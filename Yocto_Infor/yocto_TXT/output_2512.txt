Hi
There is a variable (or what ever it's called) inside a recipe. I want to know its value.
I've used `bbnote "something"` but this gives a parse error.
How to properly log?

Hi

To get a value of some variable added in recipe it is best to use bitbake
with `-e` flag which should print the whole environment, then one can just
use `grep` to search for given variable. Let say we have recipe `example.bb`
and need to know the value of `A_VAR` - with bitbake you can find it with

`bitbake -e example | grep ^A_VAR`

Thanks a lot. That works perfectly, but do you know how to use the log commands inside the recipe? It seems they work inside functions only (`do_install` e.g.)

This is not something I do a lot but from what I know, you should be able
to use `bbnote` expresions etc inside the functions like `do_install` or
`do_compile` only if you inherit the `logging` bbclass
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/tree/meta/classes/logging.bbclass within
your recipes.
