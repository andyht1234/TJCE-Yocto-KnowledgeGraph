I have a vendor project which uses CMake FetchContent.

It's simple to override FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED=ON which is set 
in the cmake class. However, that does not fix the issue since network 
isolation prevents the CMake from downloading the content.

I have not found a way to override the network isolation. Is there one?

Now this is not a discussion about whether FetchContent or not is a good 
idea and any potential other issues that could arise from using it. For 
me it's to quickly enable a functionality without jumping through hoops 
of patching the vendor sources etc.

Cheers,
Rudi

Thank you. That did the trick. I should have known that. It's one of 
these days...

Yes: do_compile[network] = “1”
