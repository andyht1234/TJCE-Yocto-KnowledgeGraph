Hi,

I have a class where I create a custom image with cryptsetup and for
that purpose I'm using sudo. AFAIK using sudo in image creation should
be OK as it runs in pseudo. sudo calls works fine in dunfell releases
but while on kirkstone I'm getting:

| sudo: error in /etc/sudo.conf, line 0 while loading plugin "sudoers_policy"
| sudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be owned by uid 0
| sudo: fatal error, unable to load plugins

Is there any workaround available or it's a pseudo issue?

Thanks and BR,

marek

Hi,

I have a similar problem. First, you need to disable pseudo before executing.
On begin of the line containing sudo cryptsetup add environment variable
definition: PSEUDO_DISABLED=1. This, however, does not solve the problem
of executing sudo. I've noticed from the recipe point of view, all files you don't own
are nobody:nogroup. This happens whether the task is in fakeroot or not.

OK so adding PSEUDO_DISABLE=1 doesn't solve an issue. It's the same like before.
Any idea what was changed and why it was working in dunfell and not in
kirkstone?

In my case, adding PSEUDO_DISABLE=1 makes /etc/sudoers.conf problem go away.
However, I am left with an error about running sudo:

| sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set

I think main problem is ownership of files in task perspective. I don't know why files are nobody:nogroup.
I spent some time on that but not found solution.
