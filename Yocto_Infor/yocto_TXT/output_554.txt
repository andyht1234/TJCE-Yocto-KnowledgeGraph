Since the base image of Yocto has the Kernel license type as GPL, if I include my UI Application binary in the Yocto Base image will I need to expose my UI App source code?

No, the same applies to desktop GNU/Linux distributions. You can 
develop, use and ship software with the license of your choice 
(including proprietary), you don't extend GPL software or link with it. 
Otherwise, only GPL compatible licenses would exist in the Linux world.

The GPL FAQ address this kind of questions: 
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html
Cheers
Michael.

Hi all.

As my personal experience with yocto and qt5 (and Qt Company) if you 
make an UI application based on Qt5 you have to give the possibility of 
reverse engineering of your application, due to Qt5 is LGPL.

So you are not mandatory to publish the code, but the system must be 
open for reverse engineerig.

A final user can replace your qt5 libraries with its own qt5 libraries 
modified

I meant: "provided you don't extend...".

Right, you have to understand the requirements of the libraries you link 
your code with.
