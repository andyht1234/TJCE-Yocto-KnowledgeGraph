 With the previous code was impossible to run the do_get_report
 task  whenever a correspondent .spdx file was already present
 in tmp/deploy/spdx.
 Now the check if spdx already exists is at a higher level
 therefore is possible to run : bitbake -c get_report

Hi Marco

I'm sorry, but your patch seems not base on the latest source code.
https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-spdxscanner/tree/classes/fossology-rest.bbclass

Best regards
Lei

Hi Lei,
my patches are based on branch MASTER therefore they are based on the 
latest source code.

Would you mind to apply this one so will be possible to call "bitbake -c 
get_report" ?

Thank you

Hi, Marco

I got what you mean, but I think your patch should be modified as the following, just make do_get_report not check spdx file again, is it ?

$ git diff classes/fossology-rest.bbclass
diff --git a/classes/fossology-rest.bbclass b/classes/fossology-rest.bbclass
index 3694440..c29e57f 100644

-    # if spdx has been exist
-    if os.path.exists(info['outfile']):

-        return
-
     spdx_get_src(d)

     bb.note('SPDX: Archiving the patched source...')

There is no necessary to add check in line 87, because line 79~85 has checked whether the spdx files exist.

Hi Lei,
you are right.
Ignore this one and please see my other patch I set a few minutes ago.

Thank you
