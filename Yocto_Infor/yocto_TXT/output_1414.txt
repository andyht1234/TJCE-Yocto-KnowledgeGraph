Hello all!

I've been just recently working with Yocto at my new position and just ran into an issue that was already solved on Yocto's main branches for both openembedded and poky layers.
There's a problem with npm on upstream kirkstone, where the fetching of dependencies fails due to stale or wrong metadata being read. This seems to have affected quite a few people (from what I browsed online), and found a solution which is already merged to the main branches for both poky and openembedded layers, done by Enrico Sholtz.
The patches are https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/project/oe-core/list/?series=4303 for poky and the patch file attached to this message.

I've applied these changes to kirkstone and it solved the issues as promised and explained by Enrico on https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/topic/91903472

I'd like to know how would one proceed to add these changes to upstream Yocto, since it would benefit a lot of people using this new LTS version of the project.

Thanks in advance,

Paulo Andrade.

commit 5bffa3f2f2c698da53fa5c4ad4418fc3087fe48d
Author: Enrico Scholz <enrico.scholz@sigma-chemnitz.de>
Date:   Thu May 19 12:23:07 2022 +0200

    nodejs-oe-cache-native: initial checkin
    
    This implements an 'npm cache add' like functionality but allows to
    specify the key of the data and sets metadata which are required to
    find the data.
    
    It is used to cache information as done during 'npm install'.
    
    Keyformat and metadata are nodejs version specific.

For OpenEmbedded-core patches: 
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded#Backporting_fixes_to_stable_releases

For meta-openembedded, I do not know how Khem deals with backport 
requests. You could do the same and then send your patch to 
openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org as explained here: 
https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded/tree/master/meta-oe ? 
You can also open a PR against the proper branch I guess. Cc'ing Khem 
just in case.

Cheers,
Quentin

Hey there Quentin!

Thanks for the update, sorry for the delay in responding; got caught up in
some other things here.
Alright man, I'm gonna study the processes and ping some other people in
this regard!
