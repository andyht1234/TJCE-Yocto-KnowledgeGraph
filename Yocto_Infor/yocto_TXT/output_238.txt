Trying to update meta-virtualization in Dunfell branch.

Previously using meta-virtualization hash used was "beea119eb529b4a11f266004aee8b548427aea39" where lxc is at 4.0.6 and when modified to "e6b6abacfb3a7273f0e4154010f749252c1eb0a2" (where lxc is at 4.0.9) following error is throwing.

Manual compilation for lxc-4.0.9 gives proper liblxc.a file.

Please, help to resolve this

Well, the first thing to do is determine what liblxc.a is.  Itâ€™s not meant to be an ELF, so the question is what is it and why does dwarfsrcfiles want to load it as ELF?
