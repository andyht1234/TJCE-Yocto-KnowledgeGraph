Hi,

I need too build fltk but the recipe from openembedded 
(http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/tree/meta-oe/recipes-support/fltk/fltk.bb?h=master) 
requires a patch file that I could not find. Hence I built my own recipe 
which looks something like:
[fltk.bb]
SUMMARY = "Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK) is a cross-platform GUI development 
library."
DESCRIPTION = "FLTK provides modern GUI functionality without the bloat 
and supports 3D graphics via OpenGL and its built-in GLUT emulation."

LICENSE = "LGPLv2.1+"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=353c9fd4163eef6500f7e057aed0b083"

SRCREV = "master"
SRC_URI = "git://github.com/fltk/fltk.git;branch=${SRCREV}"

S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

inherit autotools

do_configure_prepend() {
     ${WORKDIR}/git/autogen.sh
}
[/fltk.bb]

I'm running into an issue with autoge.sh tho, the script appears simple:
[autogen.sh]
#! /bin/sh
#
# This file is no longer referred to in the documentation, it's kept
# for backwards compatibility only.
#
# Just run `autoconf` instead to generate `configure` and you're done.
#
# The old README.Unix.txt stated that it should be executed from within
# the "FLTK source-code directory", hence changing directories is not
# useful and would break if the user's home directory contained spaces.
# Changing directories has been removed in FLTK 1.4.0 and this file
# has been simplified substantially.
#
# Instead of executing it as documented in pre-1.4 README files the new docs
# instruct to just execute `autoconf` which is sufficient and equivalent to
# the old instructions.

autoconf --force || exit 1

test -n "$NOCONFIGURE" || ./configure "$@"
[/autogen.sh]

However, when I attempt to build my image, I get something like:
DEBUG: Executing shell function do_configure
autoconf: error: no input file
WARNING: exit code 1 from a shell command.
ERROR: Execution of 
'/home/yocto/rzg_vlp_v3.0.0/build/tmp/work/aarch64-poky-linux/fltk/1.0-r0/temp/run.do_configure.242968' 
failed with exit code 1

The autoconf man page states:

"-f, --force
consider all files obsolete"
i.e. I would expect it to work w/o any input files. What am I missing 
and how can I get fltk built succesfully?

Hi Takayasu,

Thank you for this. I have cloned the fltk/ dir from the dunfell branch 
to my build host. This seemed to help out with the fltk issue but I have 
to suspend work on this for now.

Thanks,

Ron
