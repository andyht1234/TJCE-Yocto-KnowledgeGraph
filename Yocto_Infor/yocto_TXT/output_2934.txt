You somehow mixed Windows and Linux Cmake build systems. Not sure how...

Solution 1: fix on the fly current problem:
You should inspect the file: src/CMakeLists.txt and try to fix Windows
paths to match Linux paths.

Solution 2: delete the current Cmake setup and execute it from scratch:
Error should not happen, since you need to delete the Cmake setup and
do the whole thing from scratch.
    1) configure <<===== This step causes you problems!
    2) make
    3) make install

1. From version 5.85 I assume you use meta-qt5-extra (not meta-kf5) - right?
2. the important part of the log is:

| CMake Error in src/CMakeLists.txt:
| Imported target "KF5::WindowSystem" includes non-existent path
| "/home/yocto/sources/fu540-build/tmp-glibc/work/riscv64-oe-linux/kwindowsystem/5.85.0-r0/recipe-sysroot/usr/include"

That means that kwindowsystem did not install all necessary bits. Do
you have x11 in your DISTRO_FEATURES? If not you should add that.

Hope that helps

Andreas

Oh, I see... It has everything to do with Xwindows systems in X11
Client/Server domain.

kwindoes => KDE desktop.

Apology for the confusion!
