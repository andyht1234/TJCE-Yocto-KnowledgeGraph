Greetings,

I wanted to customize the boot splash image for an i.MX6 system.

I'm using Kirkstone and created a psplash/psplash_%.bbappend file in a 
custom layer:

SPLASH_IMAGES = "file://krtek.png;outsuffix=default"
FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/files:"

The "files/krtek.png" file has a 800x480 resolution, which matches my 
display's.

However, the screen shows two white stripes at the bottom (see the 
attached picture). Actually, the top stripe is added on top of the 
original picture, and the bottom one corresponds to the picture being 
translated upwards (see the attached original picture).

I'm running a 4.19 Linux kernel. I couldn't reproduce this issue on a 
qemux86-64 system (same picture, 5.15 kernel), though the QEMU display 
has a greater resolution.

Has anyone seen this before, or would anyone have an idea why this happens?
Thanks in advance
Cheers
Michael.

It looks like the text box for messages is still painted. try with
both sysvinit and systemd
IIRC I saw something similar with systemd a year or so ago, it might
have been different
thing dont know.

Thanks for the tip!
I am using systemd indeed. I've just tried with sysvinit, and the issue 
is the same. Anyway, I'll check the code for this text box.

Thanks again.
Cheers
Michael.

I think.

Yesss!

EXTRA_OECONF += "--disable-startup-msg --enable-img-fullscreen"
did the trick:

  * "--disable-startup-msg" to disable the upper white box (I didn't see
    the startup message anyway)
  * "--enable-img-fullscreen" to avoid the upward shift.

Many thanks!
Cheers
Michael.

Should these be PACKAGECONFIG entries in psplash recipe?
