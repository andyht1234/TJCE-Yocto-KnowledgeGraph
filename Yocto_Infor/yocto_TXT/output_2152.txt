I have a recipe aliased by RPROVIDES which I assume is working due to the project picking it up during the compile.

However, opkg does not seem to pick up the alias, returning this error:
Collected errors:
* opkg_prepare_url_for_install: Couldn't find anything to satisfy 'alias-name'.

This issue seemed to arise after upgrading Vivado to a newer version.

Any ideas?

I encountered a similar issue when updating one of my builds that uses a package feed:
https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/topic/88553371#55926

In my case the issue was that bitbake no longer resolves recursive dependencies of the do_build task:
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/?id=568f62214bca3ac6d35eef8d9f4562596fb4c9ab

This means if you use a command like “bitbake packagegroup-foo” to build your package feed, you won’t get all of the packages built. I just had to change how my package feed was generated by using "bitbake --runall build packagegroup-foo” to build my package feed from my packagegroup recipe.

I’m not sure if you’re seeing the same issue, but the symptoms are the same as what I saw.
