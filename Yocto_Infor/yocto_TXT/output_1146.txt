Hi,

This question is related to Yocto Dunfell specifically.

I have certain distro features defined (by default) in our distro
include/conf file.
These distro features are required for certain machines and should not be
enabled for only one machine.
For example, we have a distro feature such as "nand-squashfs".
So, in our distro.inc file we are including like this:
DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " nand-squashfs"

Since this distro.inc file is shared across 2-3 machines, this feature will
be available to all.
But we don't want to include it in the "xyz" machine.

So, can I do like this:
DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " nand-squashfs"
DISTRO_FEATURES_remove_xyz = " nand-squashfs"

If there is some other better way please suggest.

Thanks,
Pintu

Have you looked at COMBINED_FEATURES?

This allows you to only enable something if it is in both
DISTRO_FEATURES and MACHINE_FEATURES.

Cheers,

Richard

For such cases Yocto have the COMBINED_FEATURES that can be more apropriate
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.1.20/ref-manual/ref-variables.html#term-COMBINED_FEATURES

But if the future is only used in some machine maybe the MACHINE_FEATURES
is more apropriate
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.1.20/ref-manual/ref-variables.html#term-MACHINE_FEATURES

In a perfect world the the DISTRO_FEATURES should be independent of the
bsp/machine used
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.1.20/ref-manual/ref-variables.html#term-DISTRO_FEATURES

Jose

For example, we have a distro feature such as "nand-squashfs".

* [linux-yocto] Building Linux perf tool using bitbake

Hi,

I have a Linux distribution using Yocto thud (and Yocto dunfell later project).
Kernel: 4.14 ; ARCH: arm32

I wanted to enable Linux perf tool building as part of our Yocto image creation.
I see that the perf recipe is already present in:
poky/meta/recipes-kernel/perf/perf.bb
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/plain/meta/recipes-kernel/perf/perf.bb

But when I build it using:
$ bitbake -v perf

I get below build errors:
{{{
ERROR: Nothing PROVIDES 'binutils' (but
/local/mnt/workspace/project/poky/meta/recipes-kernel/perf/perf.bb
DEPENDS on or otherwise requires it)
binutils was skipped: it has an incompatible license: GPLv3
ERROR: Required build target 'perf' has no buildable providers.
Missing or unbuildable dependency chain was: ['perf', 'binutils']
}}}

Now, I am not sure what is the issue here and how to resolve it.
Regarding binutils I checked and it seems to be present elsewhere.
I am not sure what needs to be done for binutils, or there is
something else in my repo ?

Can someone please help me to give some pointers on this ?

Thanks,
Pintu

I’ve done a massive CC-prune, please don’t spam many lists.

Thud has been end-of-life for three years, so please move everything to at least Dunfell.

The error tells you exactly what the problem is:

> binutils was skipped: it has an incompatible license: GPLv3

You’ve disabled the use of GPLv3 packages in your images, but perf needs binutils which has GPLv3 components.

Either don’t mark GPLv3 as incompatible, or don’t use perf.
