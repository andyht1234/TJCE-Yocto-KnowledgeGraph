Hi
can you please help out with following issue
ERROR: core-image-minimal-1.0-r0 do_rootfs: Postinstall scriptlets of
['hostapd'] have failed. If the intention is to defer them to first boot,
then please place them into pkg_postinst_ontarget_${PN} ().
Deferring to first boot via 'exit 1' is no longer supported.

Thanks and regards
rohit
