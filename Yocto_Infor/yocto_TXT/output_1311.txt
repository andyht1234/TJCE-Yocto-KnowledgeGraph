Hi,

We tried two things to disable SSH by default in our image recipe:
inherit systemd
SYSTEMD_AUTO_ENABLE_openssh-sshd = "disable"

pkg_postinst_ontarget_openssh () {
    systemctl disable --now sshd.socket
}

However, both methods don't seem to work. We can still SSH to the device.
Furthermore, this is the unit list:
sshdgenkeys.service            loaded active exited       OpenSSH Key
Generation
system-sshd.slice                 loaded active active
system-sshd.slice
sshd.socket                          loaded active listening    sshd.socket

We are on openssh_7.6p1.

Any ideas why this is happening?

Kind regards,

Maik Vermeulen

Hmm, something else might override it elsewhere? I don't know.

Seems like a similar question came up in stackoverflow, where some
potential solutions are given that you might want to give a try:

Hi Maik,

this is a number of things being mixed up.
1) a recipe cannot affect another recipe. the image is a recipe, sshd is a
recipe. so you either can set this in a bbappend to thesshd recipe, or in a
config file (distro, machine, local) - but not in the image.
2) the override separator is : these days (since dunfell), not _, and you
are targetting a specific recipe. so in a config file, it would be
SYSTEMD_AUTO_ENABLE:pn-openssh-sshd
[3] 7.6p1 suggests that you are on some release made in 2017, or
comparable, and the first thing you should do is upgrade, or otherwise you
will be shipping outdated and vulnerable software right from day 1.
