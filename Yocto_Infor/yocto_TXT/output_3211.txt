Hi yall,

I'm switching from buildroot to yocto and trying to figure out how to do the equivalent of a POST_BUILD_SCRIPT.

Indeed I want to format the images built in a specific format for latter use and CI needs.

I've made a recipe (.inc) that I'm able to access directly doing so:

bitbake ycn-image -c release_ycn

To give a bit more context here's how I've made it :

File ycn-image.bb:

SUMMARY = "Ycn image"
...

require recipes-core/images/core-image-base.bb
...
inherit package-list

require ycn-release.inc
...

File ycn-release.inc:

do_release_ycn() {
...
}
addtask release_ycn after do_image_complete after do_deploy_kernelmodules

I've also tried to use IMAGE_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND without much success since it wasn't running at the proper moment.

If you happen to have any leads on the subject please don't hesitate to share!

Best regards,

Yann

In OE, the equivalent for that is probably the image types code.
See http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/classes/image_types.bbclass

You can define your own custom image types to extend the system. Some of our defaults
are quite simple (tar), some are quite complex (wic has its own bbclass).

When is "the right moment"? :)

Cheers,

Hi Richard,

Many thanks for the fast answer.

I said image, but it was probably not the best word, I just want to make a tarball of the generated image + adding some file in it.

Here's the complete file with the job :

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/files:"

SRC_URI += "file://nallino-custom-params.txt"
SRC_URI += "file://configuration_instruction_to_do_on_GUF.txt"

do_release_ycn() {

    rm -rf ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ycn_release
    mkdir -p ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ycn_release/overlays
    cp ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/fng-install.sh ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ycn_release
    cp ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ycn-image-imx6ullguf.tar.gz ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ycn_release/guf-image-imx6ullguf.tar.gz
    cp ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/*.dtbo ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ycn_release/overlays
    cp ${WORKDIR}/nallino-custom-params.txt ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ycn_release/
    cp ${WORKDIR}/configuration_instruction_to_do_on_GUF.txt ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ycn_release/
    tar -czf ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ycn_release.tar.gz ${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/ycn_release

}
addtask release_ycn after do_image_complete after do_deploy_kernelmodules

The right moment, is at the very end of bitbake, indeed I want the job to be the overall last job!

Thanks again, 

Yann

You're used to poking around things in buildroot, OE doesn't quite like you
doing that so much :)

You shouldn't really be poking around DEPLOY_DIR without letting the build
system know what you're doing. Intermediate files like the intermediate directory
you're using to create the tarball above should really be in WORKDIR.
That is itself won't break, it just not good practise. Ideally you'd write
a separate recipe to do this final piece with a do_deploy task, using the
deploy bbclass which would them take care of removing obsolete versions 
when you rebuild and so on.

You're not really helping us help you find a solution since you've not described
what you'd expect to be happening that isn't happening. How is what you have
failing?

I'm going to take a leap and guess that some of the files you expect there
aren't? Maybe the dtbo files from some other do_deploy tasks? If that is true
you're missing dependencies for your task. You can do things like:

do_release_ycn[depends] += "virtual/kernel:do_deploy"

I'd caution against "last" as it is a fine concept until two things want to 
be "last". It is usually better to describe the dependencies properly.

Cheers,

Richard
