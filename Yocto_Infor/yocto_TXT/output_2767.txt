fscrypt is a high-level tool for the management of Linux
filesystem encryption. fscrypt manages metadata, key generation,
key wrapping, PAM integration, and provides a uniform interface
for creating and modifying encrypted directories.

Add recipe for the same in 'recipes-security'.

Sorry for the double post, but since I had some issues subscribing to
the OE-list, my first attempt to post was not accepted by the mailing
list server.

Sure. I realized my mistake later-on. I should have sent it for the
'master' branch and not stable / dunfell. Can you please consider
taking this into the 'master' branch, or should I send the patch
separately.

Thanks and sorry for the late reply,
Bhupesh
