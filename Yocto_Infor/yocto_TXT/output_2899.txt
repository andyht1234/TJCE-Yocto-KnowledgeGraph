Yes, it lets you build custom Linux distribution and eases the way to
add needed customization that one might require.

Doable? Yes, everything is open source.

Sensible?  Not really.  I'm not sure you've considered the scale of
what you're asking. For example, /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts are deeply
tied into large amounts of software.

You can make *your* software use whatever configuration database you
want, but you'll have a lot of work to do if you want to move the user
database or DNS resolver information out of /etc.
