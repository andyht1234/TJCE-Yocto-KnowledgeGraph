Is there generally suggested advice regarding the importance of ECC on the build computer? I'm very new to Yocto so I'm not sure if there is a chance the final build image could experience some corruption due to flipped bits in RAM or if I'm totally overthinking this. It is also possible that Yocto does some kind of CRC checking of its own that makes this a non-issue. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thank you!

Last time I checked. The ECC vs non-ECC price difference was not worth the
time you may spend in case of a RAM bitflip.
Here, we put ECC RAM in our build systems and I guess it's quite the
industry standard.

Yocto does source integrity checks (the stuff it downloads from the
internet) but it can't do much more after that.

I've yet to debug a RAM bitflip but I guess it may trigger any kind of
weird behavior which may be hard to debug and time consuming.

My advice is : keep your time and sanity, use ECC RAM.

On the other hand, I'm yet to hear an actual case of a broken build
due to non-ECC. It's not impossible, but it seems exceedingly rare.
You're far more likely to spend 100x as much time on logical errors or
out-of-resources problems.

It actually happened in one of our build, were we had a bitflip in the
final binary which was then not working as expected.

We also had multiple cases of headers/source file corruption after the
tarball is extracted but usually those are either caught by the compiler
or don't matter at all.

Hello,

Interesting question, and I especially would like to hear on the MTBF
*measured* through the ECC detection algorithm. It can usually detect
more errors than it can correct, and I wonder if the systems admin are
notified when bitflips where detected.


Regards,

Leon.
