Add support for the Radxa Rock 3A
https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock3/3a

The TF-A project does not currently have support for
the rk3568. Therefore, for the time-being, the only way to supply a
TPL/DDR-init for the rk3568 is to use the closed-source rkbin binaries
from Rockchip. If/when TF-A adds support for the rk3588 we can investigate
switching.

recipes-bsp/rkbin/rockchip-rkbin_git.bb was modified to allow a machine
override to allow both rk3568 and rk3588s to use differnet binary blobs

Please use the same indentation here so it's aligned with the other boards.

It's 2 tabs for the indentation there it seems.

Well, we could, but also... the recipe won't be used until you add to 
COMPATIBLE_MACHINE, which means the recipe should have been working by 
the time you add it. Not entirely sure how much we want to prevent users 
to shoot their own foot honestly. But I guess it's such a small change 
that adding it is probably better than just arguing whether we need it 
or not, so maybe send another patch to add the bb.fatal :) ?

Cheers,
Quentin

This would be my vim converting my \t to spaces. I will update and resend.

If I am updating the other I will just add this to the existing patch.
I was tempted to add the obligatory "Don't know how I got here" but
didnt seem very useful and I had similar thoughts to you around if a
bb.fatal was actually required.
