Hi,

I'm wondering if there is a mechanism I could utilize to create target directories in one place that is shared between recipes? I have an image that has multiple packages being created and installed in the same directory. It has worked so far, but its fragile. Adding a new recipe that installed to these directories with the wrong permissions completely wrecked my running image. So I'm hoping to abstract the directory creation to one point to help keep things consistent.

So far all I've come up with is a .inc file that assigns the install -d commands to a variable which the individual recipes include and call during do_install. Is there a better way to do this?

Thanks,
