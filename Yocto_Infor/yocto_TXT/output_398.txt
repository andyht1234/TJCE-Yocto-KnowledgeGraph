Hi,

I am trying re-build yocto for one of the custom board having ti processor.
using dunfell branch. While creating images getting "output: Segmentation fault (core dumped)"
"
NOTE: recipe app-image-1.0-r0: task do_image_wic: Failed
ERROR: Task (...................................////.//////////:do_image_wic) failed with exit code '1'
NOTE: Tasks Summary: Attempted 5310 tasks of which 5306 didn't need to be rerun and 1 failed.
"
Note: i have working build created on 19.06, this is building successfully.

Regards,
Vijay

You need to apply
https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/project/oe-core/patch/20230623093323.4058529-1-Martin.Jansa@gmail.com/
in your build or wait for new patchelf and new uninative tarball including
that.
