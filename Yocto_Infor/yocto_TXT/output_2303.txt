[-- Attachment #1.1.1: Type: text/plain, Size: 711 bytes --]

I got a question about the linux-firmware-bcm4373 package. The link

/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4373-sdio.clm_blob -> 
../cypress/cyfmac4373-sdio.clm_blob

is packaged into linux-firmware and not into linux-firmware-bcm4373.

It's essentially not included in

FILES:${PN}-bcm4373 = 
"${nonarch_base_libdir}/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4373-sdio.bin \
   ${nonarch_base_libdir}/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4373.bin \
   ${nonarch_base_libdir}/firmware/cypress/cyfmac4373-sdio.bin \
"

which means it is automatically packaged as a "leftover" into 
linux-firmware.

Is there a reason for that or is it simply an oversight?

Thanks,
Rudi

seems an oversight.
