Hello All,
I am tyro in yocto ,

I am having a strange issue where I am trying to build the recipe  using    devtool build <recipe>  . It fails first time but builds second time.

It flags an error related to some linkage of shared library .
But when I checked the shared library , it is present at the same place,

First Error :

ERROR: <recipe-name>1-1.0-r0 do_compile: Execution of 'Path to build directory/tmp-glibc/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-ostl-linux-gnueabi/<recipe-name>/1.0-r0/temp/run.do_compile.12944' failed with exit code 2

Second Error :

-L/<path to build directory>/tmp-glibc/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-ostl-linux-gnueabi/<my recipe>1/1.0-r0/r1-1.0/<aplication name>/../<shared lib folder>/<sub folder name>  -Wl,-rpath,"\$ORIGIN/../<shared lib folder>/<sub folder name>" -l<shared lib name without lib> -pthread

When i run the same command again **( devtool build recipe
)** it builds Successfully the application referring this shared library.

Does anyone know this peculiar issue.?
Since it builds fine with no change i suspect no mistake in my Cmakefiles.

Please assist,
