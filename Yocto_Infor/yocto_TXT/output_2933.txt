It looks like a possibility, I will give it a try. I have a question about
the future,
however. Currently meta-hardening is defining its own distribution. When
hardening
will be in DISTRO_FEATURES (you were working on it some time ago
https://patchwork.openembedded.org/patch/174773/),
it would be less obvious to use, wouldn't it?

A bonus question, do you still plan to make it in DISTRO_FEATURES?

Regards,
Marta

Compilers and related utils are better restricted on production platforms.
Change permissions of all installed binutils tools to remove access from
users outside of the root group.

This also demonstrates how to restrict file permissions in a hardened
distribution.
