Hello,

I'm trying to create a simple image that uses the RPI_USE_U_BOOT option but the pi hangs with the rainbow image. I'm able to generate bootable images when not using the RPI_USE_U_BOOT option (but I need to use swupdate). I have the same problem with using the Hardknott branch, leading me to think the problem is not the layer but the way I use it.

For my last test, I used the latest meta-raspberrypi without any modification. In other words, I'm using the default/basic configuration.

the default local.conf file has been edited to add the following two lines at the end
MACHINE = 'raspberrypi4'
RPI_USE_U_BOOT = "1"

I'm building the image using
> bitbake core-image-base

And I'm burning the generated .wic image to my sd card.

What am I missing? Is there any other configuration I must do?

Thanks

Hello Jean-Philippe,

>I'm trying to create a simple image that uses the RPI_USE_U_BOOT option but the pi hangs with the rainbow image. I'm able to generate bootable images when not using the RPI_USE_U_BOOT option (but I need to use swupdate).

For me the combination of raspberrypi4-64 machine, U-Boot and RAUC (instead of swupdate) works.
I think the raspberrypi4 should also work (but haven't tested it).

I built and tested my (Poky master branch based) image this morning: https://github.com/matthiasklein/meta-yocto-coffee-rpi

I don't use HDMI output though, but a serial console (ENABLE_UART = "1").

Best regards,
Matthias

Thanks Matthias for your input.

I have the same problem using the raspberrypi4-64 target. On my end, the
mere fact of enabling RPI_USE_U_BOOT yields a non-bootable image.

The image I generated/burned can be found here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/6glmmgtx0pcd06t/core-image-base-raspberrypi4-64-20220112004201.rootfs.wic.bz2?dl=0

Thanks a lot.

For a reason I can't quite understand, everything stated working when I
added

ENABLE_UART = "1"

Does anyone understand the relation between ENABLE_UART = "1"  and
RPI_USE_U_BOOT = "1" ?

Thanks

The documentation mentions a relationship between enable_uart and
(lower) core frequency on some hardware variants - could there be a
side-effect (if yes, maybe gpu_freq/arm_freq could play a factor) ?

I finally received my UART cable, giving me more details about where the
boot sequence fails.

Just a quick summary of my tests
- Enabling UART does indeed "fix" the issue when working from the
meta-raspberrypi AND yocto master.
- Enabling UART has no impact when working from the meta-raspberrypi and
yocto hardknott branch (which I need to support) - image doesn't boot
- Backporting the meta-raspberrypi master branch to hardknott does NOT fix
the problem.

Here is the uboot log (failing).

Basically, the failing Uboot can't find the partition table.

Any idea why?

Well is there a partition table? Can you share what you are doing to
flash your uSD? Maybe it's just some manipulation error.

Hello Marc,

I doubt this is a manipulation issue (at least in regards to burning the
image).

meta-raspberrypi master, yocto master -> works (core-image-base, stock, no
modification beside RPI_USE_U_BOOT="1")

meta-raspberrypi hardknott, yocto hardknott -> doesn't work
(core-image-base, stock, no modification beside RPI_USE_U_BOOT="1")

That being said, I've inspected both the working image and the non-working
one and they look very similar (files and structure). I will take a closer
look at the format.

Thanks
