Hello list,
I don't know if this is the correct place to ask, if there is a better place, please let me know.

We are upgrading the version of Yocto that we are using, and we have run into a problem with using our mariadb server. In the past our application and our external db editor logged into our mariadb server using root and no password, that is getting locked down, so I need to configure mariadb with a login user and password. We have found a way to do that on a live system but we would like to bake that into our yocto build system so we don't have to mess with the database every time we generate a new Yocto build.

I have searched online and haven't been able to find anything that suggests a way to configure a default login name and password, is there a way to do that?

Thanks in advance for any help you can give me,
Greg Wilson-Lindberg
