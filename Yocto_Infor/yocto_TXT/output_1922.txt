3.3.6 built but there were two issues. One was a qemu boot test failure for
core-image-sato-sdk on qemuppc-alt. I did have a look for logs but there aren't
any, qemu never seemed to start but nothing to indicate why. Since the other
tests for ppc passed, I think this is one of our general intermittent problems
on ppc and we should ignore it.

The other was some valgrind ptest failures. Those are known intermittent issues
and I believe also not significant from a release perspective.

Cheers,

Richard

OK I would be fine to go with this assertion and perhaps monitor it closely to be classified as intermittent or something one off.

It doesn't usually happen and works fine in other builds so it is intermittent.
Whether it is one of our "known" intermittent issues, I don't know. I couldn't
get any real information from the system about why it failed. We have better
logging in master.

Cheers,

Richard
