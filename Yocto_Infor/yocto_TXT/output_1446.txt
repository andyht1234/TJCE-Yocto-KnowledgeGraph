I'm using Yocto Zeus and found that there is a memory leak in Python 3.7 threading.py

https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c10c2ec7a0e06975e8010c56c9c3270f8ea322ec
As far as I know, this was not fixed until Python 3.9.
What is the easiest way to incorporate this fix into Zeus?  Create a patch with devtool?  Upgrade Python to at least 3.9?
