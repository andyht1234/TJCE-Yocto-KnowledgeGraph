Hello,

We, the German Linux magazine, are planning a focus on Linux distributions for the IoT in the 07/22 issue. One of them we have in mind is Yocto. We are therefore looking for an author who can introduce Yocto to our readers in an article. Such an article should be four to six pages (about 4000 characters each) and cover questions such as:

- What is Yocto? (main purpose, target audience, compatibility)
- Scope of services
- Differences and similarities compared to similar operating systems
- Advantages and disadvantages
- Examples of use

After reading this, one should be able to estimate whether Yocto meets the user's expectations and whether it is worth trying out.

Is there anyone out there who would like and have the time to write such an article for us? We would pay 80 Euro per printed page. We prefer plain ASCII as text format and need some illustrations (screenshots or diagrams or photos). Please contact me at jens-christoph.brendel@computec.de.

Thanks in advance
Jens-Christoph
