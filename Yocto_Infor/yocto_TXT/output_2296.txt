Hello,

so I'm a bit at a loss. I admit, I've not yet been using Yocto for a long
time. I'm trying to use base-utils as provided by
packagegroup-core-base-utils to have a more full featured set of base utils
instead of busybox. It all builds just fine, however, whatever I do (using
dunfell), it ends up with a kernel panic during boot.

I added the following to local.conf on a clean clone of poky:

INIT_MANAGER="systemd"

IMAGE_FSTYPES="live"

PREFERRED_PROVIDER_base-utils = "packagegroup-core-base-utils"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_base-utils = "packagegroup-core-base-utils"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_base-utils-hwclock = "util-linux-hwclock"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_base-utils-syslog = ""

Does anyone have any idea how to get this to work?

Regards,

Paul van Berlo

Hi Paul,

Try adding:

VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_base-utils-syslog = "syslog"

as shown on:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/tree/meta-poky/conf/local.conf.sample.extended#n371

I would expect that since you have systemd, you'd have the systemd 
journal as well so
you wouldn't need syslog but it would be good to do a sanity check.


If that doesn't help, show us what the kernel panic is saying.
Is this with a custom BSP and if so can you reproduce with qemux86-64?

Try the same things using poky on the master branch if you can.

Hi,

Adding that line results in an error:

ERROR: Nothing RPROVIDES 'syslog' (but
/yocto/poky-dunfell/meta/recipes-core/packagegroups/
packagegroup-core-boot.bb,
/yocto/poky-dunfell/meta/recipes-core/initrdscripts/
initramfs-module-install_1.0.bb,
/yocto/poky-dunfell/meta/recipes-core/initrdscripts/
initramfs-module-install-efi_1.0.bb RDEPENDS on or otherwise requires it)

The kernel panic ends with "not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
exitcode=0x00000100". This is using the genericx86-64 machine.

Regards,

Paul van Berlo
