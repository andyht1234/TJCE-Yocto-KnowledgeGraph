Hi all,

when I use "devtool deploy-target" with the --strip option in the eSDK, the ownership cannot be preserved during copying the files from "image" to "deploy-target-stripped":

devtool deploy-target --strip --no-host-check --no-preserve less root@192.168.7.2
cp: failed to preserve ownership for '/home/yocto/sdk/tmp/work/cortexa9t2hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/less/551-r0/deploy-target-stripped/usr/bin/less': Operation not permitted

INFO: Successfully deployed /home/yocto/sdk/tmp/work/cortexa9t2hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/less/551-r0/deploy-target-stripped

On the target, the deployed files have then the ownership of the eSDK user:

root@qemu:~# ls -lah /usr/bin/less
-rwx------    1 1002     1003      116.7K Jun 24 08:53 /usr/bin/less

"devtool deploy-target" without the --strip option works as expected. The files are owned by root.

The eSDK has been built and installed on the same machine (tested on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04).
Used Yocto release: 3.1.8

Thanks in advance for any help!

Best regards,
Florian
