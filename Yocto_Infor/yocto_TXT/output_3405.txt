Dear all,

there have been recent reports of a hostile takeover of the freenode
service, as described in
https://gist.github.com/joepie91/df80d8d36cd9d1bde46ba018af497409

The Yocto Project should verify these reports and take the necessary
actions, in order to protect its users.

Thanks for your email. We are aware, and have started to look into that.

It looks like some open source communities have started to move to
https://www.oftc.net/ or https://libera.chat/.. If anyone wants to bring
any insights or recommendations... feel free!

OFTC is very good, IMO. It's been reliable, well managed, provides a good
selection of services, provides a web client for anyone not particularly
familiar with IRC clients,  and supports SSL + CertFP in addition to
standard auth mechanisms.

I disagree. Matrix just does not work. I've been using with a few
friends with mixed homeservers, chat.privacytools.io, matrix.org,
converser.eu and self-hosted homeservers... I've sometimes not received
tens of messages in a row, usually for a duration of at least 15 mins
and there's obviously no indication whatsoever that I didn't receive
messages except that the discussion does not make sense at all. And this
happened to three other people on the room, each on a different homeserver
than the other, so not a PEBKAC :) Sometimes there are delays for
messages too (I've seen 30min delays), so the whole context is lost.

For a federated chat solution, that's really a bummer that its main
feature is just so buggy it's unusable.

If YP is ok with potentially not receiving questions or having people
ask questions and not receive answers, then fine by me :)

I'm probably among the small (?) minority of people experiencing those
issues but that's not a bet I'd take with my projects.

My 2¢.

Cheers,
Quentin

I think the question of setting up Matrix for our community is a valid
question, though I think it's orthogonal to the current problem. If
freenode goes away , we need an alternate plan to move *right away* to
another IRC server. If we want to setup addition communications means (such
as Matrix or anything else) that needs to be discussed and it might take
more time.

First let me say, there is nothing wrong with matrix, have used it every 
day for years

Second

the discussion is now about libre


there's a relay to relay stuff between libera and freenode?!
magic
LiberaRelay (relay@2607:f5a0:0:7::9) has joined #hardenedbsd
[Libera] R​elay (relay@user/relay) has joined #hardenedbsd
xmj: sup ? Libra?? whats dat ?
new irc net, made by freenode staffers that have been booted
freenode went through a hostile takeover
... in case you haven't noticed ;p
