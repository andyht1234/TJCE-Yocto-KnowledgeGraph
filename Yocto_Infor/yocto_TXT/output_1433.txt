Key Status/Updates:

*	We are now at feature freeze for 4.1 but M3 has not been built yet.
*	Many of the blocking issues for M3 have been resolved including:

*	perl build hangs
*	cve-check database issues
*	hash-equiv file not found issues on local domain sockets
*	layer setup changes merged
*	rust upgrade merged
*	libgcrypt ptest issues on ARM is potentially fixed
*	llvm build path corruption in mesa was resolved
*	rust ppc patch was revised
*	llvm-config handling in core was reworked
*	nativesdk-gcc issue breaking rust SDK tests was identified and fixed
*	a checksum mismatch race issue in bitbake's fetcher code was fixed

*	Thanks to everyone who helped work on and resolve these, it will
significantly improve the release and autobuilder stability during testing.
*	There is still an issue with rust SDK failures on ubuntu1804 to
resolve before M3 can build
*	The rust selftest changes are looking unlikely to merge as they
don't pass during testing yet and one of the precursor patches causes
buildpath issues. Some precursor patches did merge.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:

*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:

ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
