Hi Patrick,
very likely you moved this recipe from an arm-32bit to Aarch64, therefore you should use a different source SRC_URI.
Test locally the architecture of the files you have in *libtorchtrt.tar.gz* with: *file libtorchtrt.so*
However the mere binary copy is now doing a QA task and facing to an architecture mismatch.
You can ignore the error adding *INSANE_SKIP_${PN} += "arch"* in the recipe.
