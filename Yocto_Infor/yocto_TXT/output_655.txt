Changelog:
  3.2.2
    A buffer overflow in tss2-rc as CVE-2023-22745.
    The drv layer in tss2-rc should have been the policy layer.
    Spec deviation in Fapi_GetDescription caused description to be NULL when it should be empty string.
    This is API breaking but considered a bug since it deviated from the FAPI spec.
    FAPI: undefined reference to curl_url_strerror when using curl less than 7.80.0.
  3.2.1
    Makefile.am: make all EXTRA_DIST includes unconditional to fix pristine tars
    Fix usage of NULL pointer if Esys_TR_SetAuth is calles with ESYS_TR_NONE.
    Store VERSION into the release tarball.
    fapi: fix usage of policy_nv with a TPM nv index.
    Tss2_Sys_Flushcontext: flushHandle was encoded as a handleArea handle and not as parameter one, this affected the contents of cpHash.
    linking tcti for libtpms against tss2-tctildr. It should be linked against tss2-mu.
    build: Remove erroneous trailing comma in linker option. Bug #2391.
    esys: fix allow usage of HMAC sessions for Esys_TR_FromTPMPublic.
    test: build with opaque FILE structure like in musl libc.
    Usage of a second profile in a path was not possible because the default profile was always used.
    FAPI: Fix provisioning if auth value for storage hierarchy was set.
    FAPI: Fix recreation of EK.
    FAPI: Fix usage of lockout auth value in Fapi_Provison.
    FAPI: Fix loading of key in policy execution.
    FAPI: Fix Fapi_ChangeAuth updates on hierarchy objects not being reflected across profiles.
    Esys_PCR_SetAuthValue: remembers the auth like other SetAutg ESAPI functions.
    tests: esys-pcr-auth-value.int moved to destructive tests.
    FAPI: Fix double free if keystore is corrupted.
    Spec deviation in Fapi_GetDescription caused description to be NULL when it should be empty string.
        This is API breaking but considered a bug since it deviated from the FAPI spec.

Hi,

Since master has 4.0.1 and CVE is impacting:

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22745

"Up to (including)
4.0.0"

then I guess master branch and 4.0.1 is not impacted. Would be nice to
have this info in commit message though.

Cheers,

-Mikko

Hi,

I'm not a big fan of commit messages saying that other branch has it fixed.
But yes, I forgot to mark the CVE as fixed, so sent a v2.

Peter
