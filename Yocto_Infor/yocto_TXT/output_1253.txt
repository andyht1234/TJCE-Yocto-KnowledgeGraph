Hi,

I would like to install nmcli.
I'm working with yocto dunfell and to achieve this, I added  the 
following to IMAGE_INSTALL in 
meta-laird-cp-pre-3.4/recipes-packages/images/sample-image-cp-lwb5plus.bb:

          laird-networkmanager \
         networkmanager-nmcli \
         "
and added the meta-laird-cp-pre-3.4 layer to bblayers.conf
but still a
tar -tvjf 
tmp/deploy/images/machine-name/my-image-smarc-rzv2l-<date>.rootfs.tar.bz2 
| grep nmcli
does not return anything when I expect it to. There should be an nmcli 
binary in the rootfs, should there not?

Also:
$ bitbake -s |grep nmcli
Does not return anything either but:
$ bitbake -s |grep networkmanager
returns:
lib32-lrd-networkmanager-sterling               :10.4.0.10-r0
lib32-lrd-networkmanager-summit                 :10.4.0.10-r0
lib32-networkmanager                              :1.22.10-r0
lib32-networkmanager-openvpn                       :1.8.12-r0
lib32-python3-networkmanager                          :2.1-r0
lrd-networkmanager-sterling                     :10.4.0.10-r0
lrd-networkmanager-summit                       :10.4.0.10-r0
networkmanager                                    :1.22.10-r0
networkmanager-openvpn                             :1.8.12-r0
python3-networkmanager                                :2.1-r0

What else am I missing to get nmcli?


meta-laird-cp-pre-3.4/recipes-packages/images/sample-image-cp-lwb5plus.bb:

DESCRIPTION = "Sterling LWB5+ SDIO/UART M.2 (diversity antenna) sample 
image"
LICENSE = "MIT"

         splash \
         "

IMAGE_FEATURES_remove = "\
         tools-profile \
         tools-debug \
         tools-testapps \
         "

IMAGE_INSTALL += "\

Hi,
I don't know it there is a mistake on your message, but you inserted the lines on:

* recipes-packages/images/ *sample-image-cp-lwb5plus*.bb

but then you are searching the tar on image name "

* tmp/deploy/images/machine-name/ *my-image-smarc-rzv2l-* <date>.rootfs.tar.bz2

Unless you include/inherit the file sample-image-cp-lwb5plus.bb on my-image-smarc-rzv2l.bb file, this wouldn't work.
You should make sure the IMAGE_INSTALL is correctly appended on the image file you are compiling. To debug this, you could print the IMAGE_INSTALL variable for the image, and see if the nmcli package is there:

bitbake -e sample-image-cp-lwb5plus | grep "IMAGE_INSTALL="

Another way to check what is installed on the image is to open the manifest file on the deploy directory (*.manifest)

Oh, I see! I did not realize that I was changing the IMAGE_INSTALL 
variable in the wrong image to begin with . Thanks for directing me to 
the realization! :)
