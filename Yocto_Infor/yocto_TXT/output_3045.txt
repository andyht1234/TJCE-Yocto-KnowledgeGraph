IMAGE_FEATURES="debug-tweaks read-only-rootfs"

according to the manual having read-only-rootfs should remove run-postinsts and I still have it.  How can I get rid of this?

local.conf:   PACKAGE_EXCLUDE = "run-postinsts"

This didn't do anything either.

That's not what I understand from the manual. From
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/common-tasks.html#post-installation-scripts-and-read-only-root-filesystem,
I understand that the build system makes sure that the post install
scripts all succeed, so there is no need to run them again on the target.

Why would you want to skip the post install scripts?

Cheers,
Michael.
