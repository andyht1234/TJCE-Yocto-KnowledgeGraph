This will not apply because run-docs-build is in the scripts directory inside yocto-autobuilder-helper git repo. I'm wondering how you got this patch. Do you mind explaining how you created the patch so we can help you fix its creation?

We do not (fortunately!) have access to your home directory on your PC so this cannot be merged. We need a patch which adds those two scripts in yocto-autobuilder-helper git repo and then use them. You already sent another patch for the scripts, so they just need to be sent together in one patch. git commit --amend and/or git rebase -i will help you merging two commits.

Also, once the script is inside yocto-autobuilder-helper git repo, we don't need to copy it anymore :)

Since those scripts have a Python shebang (#!/usr/bin/env python3) you dont need to call the scripts with python3 in front because the shell will do it automatically for you.

Also, you should use $scriptdir/htmlscript.py once it's put in the correct directory since we already are in outputdir at those lines in the script and the files aren't supposed to be in outputdir (outputdir is the directory where all files that needs to be served by docs.yoctoproject.org are, and we don't want this script to be there).

Cheers,
Quentin
