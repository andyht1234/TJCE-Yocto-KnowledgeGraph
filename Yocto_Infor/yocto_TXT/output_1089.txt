Hi,
I need to add X11 to my build (original BSP is based on wayland) but 
keep running into an issue:
I keep getting "error: Glamor for Xorg requires gbm >= 10.2.0", the 
complete message can be seen below:

| checking for GLAMOR... yes
| checking for GBM... no

I've tried to add dependencies to my image recipe (mesa) that doesn't 
appear to change anything.
Any hints would be greatly appreciated!
