Hi all,
So I am referring this page for OTA updates
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/System_Update

However are these all paid or free services. Any more info about these
services is welcomed.
Also are there any tutorials, YouTube videos on ota updates for yocto? I
couldnâ€™t find any though.


Regards,
Hassan

For Mender there is a pretty detailed guide on how to build and run a demo
image at
https://docs.mender.io/operating-system-updates-yocto-project/build-for-demo
Various board integrations are maintained on
https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender-community, and/or documented
on hub.mender.io.

As the integrations and procedures vary quite a bit, there is no
one-size-fits all tutorial.

Greetz,
Josef

Full disclosure: I work for Mender.

Foundries offers ostree compatible OTA support (with paid cloud
services), including support for the update framework (TUF) and a few
extra CI/CD services, besides device management. You can find more
documentation about the service, the meta layers integration and
supported targets at https://docs.foundries.io/latest/.

I and DENX offer services around SWUpdate as OTA service - 
https://swupdate.org/services. Layers and documentation can be retrieved 
at https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/.

Hello,

we have implemented OTA based on OSTree, in a non-commercial
no-license-fee setting, to update OTA over mobile (3G/4G) data
connections.

I remember the OTA server was really easy to setup.

We let Yocto deploy directly to the OTA server, using CI/CD.

Basically the server worked out of the box, running a few ostree
commands. We added a GUI to have visual version management, deployment
branches, rollbacks etc. with a few PHP scripts.

If you go this route, just run the ostree from the command line on
both the client and server, and you will quickly understand how it
works, and how you would like to wrap it up.

Regards,

Leon.

for RAUC (which is also noted on the page you referred) there is a quite comprehensive documentation
available at https://rauc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

The interesting details about integrating RAUC OTA updates into your Yocto/OE-based BSP using the
meta-rauc [1] layer can be found in https://rauc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration.html#yocto

From the community, there is also a set of example layers available collected in meta-rauc-
community:
https://github.com/rauc/meta-rauc-community/

I have once written a blog post for a quick-start using RAUC from within a QEMU test environment
(built with poky and meta-rauc-qemux86:
https://www.pengutronix.de/de/blog/2022-02-03-tutorial-evaluating-rauc-on-qemu-a-quick-setup-with-yocto.html

There are also talks from Leon available on how to use meta-rauc-community, e.g.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6r-jSTudGA&ab_channel=YoctoProject

For a full list of RAUC-related talks, videos, etc. see https://rauc.io/pages/media.html

For questions and discussions there is a IRC/Matric chat as well as GitHub discussions and
professional support. The options are collected under https://rauc.io/pages/support.html .

Hope that helps. Good luck with finding the right OTA update solution for your needs ðŸ˜‰


Best regards

Enrico
