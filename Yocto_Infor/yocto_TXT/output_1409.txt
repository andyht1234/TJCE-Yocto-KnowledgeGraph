Hello,

I am trying to include a go project in my yocto build. It has quite a few dependencies. I may have missed something, there is a meta-go around that I have missed? Or a quick way of pulling in multiple dependencies.
Thanks

Edmund Watson

It helps if you can name the project. Are the sources public?

Right, I don't think such a dedicated layer exists. You may want to go
over the list of dependencies and type them into
http://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/recipes/ to
see if anything comes up.

Otherwise, you just have to list them one by one in SRC_URI, so
bitbake will compose the source tree in a 'vendored' fashion.

You can ask Konrad about it. But please keep the mailing list in CC,
so that the entire conversation remains visible and archived to all.
