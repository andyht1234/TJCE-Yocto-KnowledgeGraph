Hi,

I have following errors:

No GNU_HASH in the ELF binary
/build/tmp-glibc/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi/solar/1.0.0-0/packages-split/wifi_signal,
didn't pass LDFLAGS? [ldflags]

So I add --hash-style=gnu to my Makefile:

LD_FLAGS += --hash-style=gnu
LDFLAGS = LD_FLAGS

But that does not work:

arm-oe-linux-gnueabi-gcc: error: unrecognized command line option
'--hash-style=gnu'

What is wrong about the error if the  --hash-style=gnu is not the right fix?

Thank you.

Kind regards.

JH

You need to show the full command line that produces the error.

So it seems your makefile is not respecting the LDFLAGS coming from
the environment during linking.
perhaps you should fix that in your linking rules. hardcoding hash
style like this is not portable.
