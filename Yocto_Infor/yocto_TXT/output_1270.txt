Hello List

i want to apply rt-patch in raspberry-pi by following ( using-traditional-kernel-development-to-patch-the-kernel ( https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.1.20/kernel-dev/kernel-dev-common.html#using-traditional-kernel-development-to-patch-the-kernel ) ) So in order to achieve that i created my own meta-layer and put that patch in bblayers. In oreder to apply patching i did following steps .

* I downloaded patch file from ( https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.4/older/patch-5.4.70-rt40.patch.gz ) unzip and rename with ( patch-5.4.70-rt40.patch) ( https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.4/older/patch-5.4.70-rt40.patch.gz )
* I put that file in yocto/meta-mylayer/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto.
* And given patch file's path inÂ yocto/meta-mylayer/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_4.12.bbappend by following lines

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}-${PV}:"
SRC_URI += "file://patch-5.4.70-rt40.patch"
