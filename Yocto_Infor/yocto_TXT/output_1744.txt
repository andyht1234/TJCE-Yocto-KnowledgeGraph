Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.1 M1 was built and been through QA with one kernel issue
raised. We will likely release and fix this for M2, pending TSC approval.
*	YP 3.1.17 rc1 was built but failed on the autobuilder, partly due to
infrastructure issues but also failing ptests in openssl, likely due to
expired certificates. As of writing,  rc2 is building after infrastructure
fixes but the ptest fixes were insufficient. If there are no other issues we
will aim to release rc2 and fix the openssl ptest regressions for 3.1.18
pending TSC approval.
*	Patches have continued to merge into master but have been slowed
down by various intermittent issues showing up on the autobuilder:

*	We have bumped the minimum make version for the project and added a
make-native dependency for perl to avoid bugs in old make 4.1 versions
(particularly on ubuntu 18.04).
*	There are some fixes for potential deadlock issues in the bitbake UI
on the bitbake list for review
*	We also have some tweaks to the wget fetcher to allow infrastructure
mirror races to be avoided.

*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enhan

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
