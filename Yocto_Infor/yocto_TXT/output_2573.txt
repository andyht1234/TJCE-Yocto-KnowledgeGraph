How do I get a -native recipe to use clang-native?  I have this in my
recipe, and target variant builds with clang:

RUNTIME = "llvm"
TOOLCHAIN = "clang"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER:libgcc = "compiler-rt"

All the environment variables are setup for gcc in the case of -native.  No
sign of clang.

This is with honister.

Thanks, I'll check it out.

This works:

DEPENDS += "\
    compiler-rt \
    libcxx \
    llvm \
    "

RUNTIME = "llvm"
TOOLCHAIN = "clang"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER:libgcc = "compiler-rt"

RUNTIME:class-native = "llvm"
TOOLCHAIN:class-native = "clang"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER:libgcc:class-native = "compiler-rt"
