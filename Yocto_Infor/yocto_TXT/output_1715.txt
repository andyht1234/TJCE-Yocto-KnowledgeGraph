Specific provider (ie. RPM or IPK) does "provide" just itself as a
package to the system. This will cause the "-dev" package, which
refers to the generic signing-keys and not the provider specific,
to miss the dependency.

Error case (RPM) when populating sdk:

Error:
 Problem: conflicting requests
  - nothing provides signing-keys = 1.0-r0 needed by signing-keys-dev-1.0-r0.noarch
(try to add '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages)

Examining signing-keys-rpm packages in PROVIDES we have indeed:
signing-keys-rpm = 1.0-r0

But in signing-keys-dev: in REQUIRES:
signing-keys-1.0-r0

This MR will fix the situation bringing the specific provider
PROVIDES to include also the generic package (RPM example):
signing-keys
signing-keys-rpm = 1.0-r0

Likely another way could be also to change the requirement for
dev or just allow empty packages as well.
