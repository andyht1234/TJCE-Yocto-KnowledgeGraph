Hi,



I’m trying to customize the SERIAL_CONSOLES variable. In another thread I
read this can be done by adding a machine-extra.conf file too my custom
layer. So I added “ SERIAL_CONSOLES = "115200;ttymxc0" ” to my
machine-extra.conf, but when I  bitbake my custom image, no changes are
found.

In the conf file from the bsp for the board I’m using I found
“SERIAL_CONSOLES = "115200;ttymxc2", when I change this to SERIAL_CONSOLES
?= "115200;ttymxc2" my changes are being applied.

This off course is not ideal since I then still don’t have all changes in
my own layer.

Is there a way I can solve this?



Kind regards,



Chris

there can be multiple entries in SERIAL_CONSOLES so you might try
adding instead of replacing

 SERIAL_CONSOLES += "115200;ttymxc0"

might work

Thank you for you reply.

I actually do want to replace SERIAL_CONSOLES because I am using the original for another purpose ( not a console).

I'd suggest adding some "bogus" things to your machine-extra.conf, 
because I don't think the file will actually be used (or even parsed) 
anywhere.

You can override SERIAL_CONSOLES in your DISTRO config, as that takes 
precedence over the machine config. In local.conf it won't work because 
the MACHINE config is included after it.

Another approach is to grep on which recipes use it (half a dozen) and 
then create a bbappend for each. That's the approach I've used recently.

I did run bitbake with the -e option and it shows that it does process my
machine extra config, but it's overriden by the conf of the BSP.  As a test
I also added it to my layer.conf but this is also being overriden. I
already set my layer too the highest priority.
How can I fix this?

I eventually fixed it by modifying /etc/inittab directly with
ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND. This was the only way it worked.
