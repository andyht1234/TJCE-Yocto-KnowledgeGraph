Hi,
I need to relabel the rootfs at build time instead of first boot. Currently, I am using thud branch of meta-selinux. I came across the series of patches mentioned below to enable relabelling at build time. Out of these patches some are already pushed to thud branch and some are not present. So, can someone in the community help me to figure out what all patches are required.
Also, I was thinking of using ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND or IMAGE _POSTPROCESS_COMMAND to relabel the filesystem. If this is possible what would be the steps in the postprocess funtion. Do I have to use restorecon command or setfiles command to relabel the filesystem.
The link to the series of patches is shown below:
filesystem relabel at build time ( https://www.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/2015-June/025141.html )

Please provide you valuable inputs on this. If you need any more information feel free to contact

Thanks
Kamal Pandey

I am, as we speak (Real Time here and now) working on Android 10 and
12 SELinux...

Has not too much to do with YOCTO. But I can tell you... It is bloody
tough stuff. Especially crossing the domains...

If you have any questions about that, you can ask me. If I can help? If so?
