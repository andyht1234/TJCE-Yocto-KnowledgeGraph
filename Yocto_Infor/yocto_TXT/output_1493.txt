Hi,

Currently we are struggling with 'interdependent' recipes.

For example:
A webservice of ours uses a specific port, and needs to be allowed through
the firewall, for which we also have a recipe.

Is there a neat way to make sure that the firewall recipe only allows that
specific port if that webservice recipe is actually included in the image?
And the firewall recipe should allow the port configured in the webservice
recipe?

Thanks,
Kind regards,

Maik Vermeulen

The neat way would be to include appropriate configuration into the
webserver recipe, e.g. a file installed in /etc/firewall.d/ that opens the
port (and nothing else).
