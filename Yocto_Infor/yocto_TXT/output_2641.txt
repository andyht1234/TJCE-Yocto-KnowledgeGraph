Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.4 has been released. Thanks to everyone who contributed!
*	YP 3.3.4 is due to build this week and will be the last planned
release of the hardknott series.
*	YP 3.5 Planning document:

*	Git's default branch choice could potentially change in the future
and we're seeing service providers like github change policy too. To react
to this variability the project really needs to start encoding the branch
name used in SRC_URI rather than having a default of master. OE-Core has
been converted and there is a script ( scripts/contrib/convert-srcuri.py) to
help with conversions. Bitbake will start warning where this is unset soon
(patch in master-next).
*	Github has announced that git protocol support will be dropped as of
January. We use this in a number of our SRC_URIs. This has been discussed on
the architecture list and we have a plan to warn (and later error) on
problematic urls and magically map to the correct urls within bitbake. The
latter change is easily backported to older bitbake releases and will allow
older branches to continue to function without invasive changes. The
conversion script mentioned above can also convert github urls.
*	We have seen a drop in the number of patches in "Pending" state,
partly thanks to work from Richard to send libtool and gcc patches upstream
or otherwise clean them up. Others are also stepping forward to try and
reduce the number of patches in Pending state, help would be much
appreciated as spread over a number of people this could be quickly handled
and reduced.
*	Intermittent issues continue to rise and help is very much welcome
on these issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to see by
searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.

*	Patches to master are continuing to merge including a large number
of version upgrades this week.
*	We have 1,288 patches in OE-Core, a third of those are marked as
"Pending". Help in determining what to do with those would be most welcome.
Richard cleaned up and submitted a batch of 12 to the libtool project this
week as an example of what can be done. Several gcc patches could be dropped
or merged too.
*	Intermittent issues continue to rise, particularly with some
seemingly network related gremlin somewhere. Help is very much welcome on
these issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to see by
