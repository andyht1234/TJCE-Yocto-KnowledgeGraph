Hi everyone,

I have a task to add browser to my yocto project and start it immediately after it is booted. Also I have to open specific web page. Any suggestions how to do it? Any advice would be helpful.

Thanks in advance!

Hi, 

Kiosk mode is what you're looking for. Just google for "Yocto kiosk" and you'll see few solutions like:
