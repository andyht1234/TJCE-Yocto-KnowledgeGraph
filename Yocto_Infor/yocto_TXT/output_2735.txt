Hi,

The Yocto uses /etc/profile for root login, but there is no root
physical login in an embedded device so the /etc/profile is never
called, I added a shell script to /etc/profile.d, it was not called
either. Both /etc/profile and scripts in /etc/profile.d can only be
invoked when I physically log into the debug console, that is
impractical. Appreciate your advice, how do you resolve that kind of
problem?

Thank you.

Kind regards,

- jupiter

What problem are you attempting to solve by running a script from
/etc/profile.d?

Hi Jupiter,
/etc/profile and similar are interactive shell (/bash) concepts, not really
system startup ones. So indeed: just on a login (be it local, ssh and so
on) they are executed.

If you want to execute something else without the need for logging it, you
should look elsewhere, depending on your system manager: if systemd you
should create a service and enable it, if sysvinit a init.d script.

HTH,
Federico

Hi Federico,

Thanks for your response.

Understood, here is what I try to figure out. I use several systemd
services to start my tasks, each task is not just a system process, I
found it also has a system environment similar in user login from
/etcprofile, /home/user/.profile, my question is where is a system
environment file that each systemd service runs from?

I also thought that /etc/profile.d files should be automatically
invoked for each user login, but a systemd service does not run
/etc/profile.d files.

Understood, that was what I did originally, I have to run the setup
system environment in each service ExecStart script, that is why I am
looking for a global environment setup file to avoid duplication of
putting my environment scripts in each ExecStart execution file.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

Hi Jupiter,
To centralize, agreed that you are using systemd, one way I could see is
setting the variables in systemd-system.conf using the DefaultEnvironment
directive, see:
https://freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-system.conf.html

This states:

----
DefaultEnvironment=Â¶
<https://freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-system.conf.html#DefaultEnvironment=>

Configures environment variables passed to all executed processes. Takes a
space-separated list of variable assignments. See environ(7)
<http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html> for details about
environment variables.

Simple "%"-specifier expansion is supported, see below for a list of
supported specifiers.

Example:

DefaultEnvironment="VAR1=word1 word2" VAR2=word3 "VAR3=word 5 6"

Sets three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3".
----

This should have you variables management in each. Otherwise as you mention
one can put in each script with either Environment to have them explicitly
enumerated or with EnvironmentFile to read from a file, which may also fit
your centralization hopes (but still require one line per startup script at
least) and could be further sourced by non-systemd components as well if
needed. (https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html
under Environment section)

HTH,
Federico
