Hi All,

We were trying to add a custom sdktest script as shown in example
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/test-manual/intro.html#testsdk.

The script gets invoked when placed in meta/lib/oeqa/sdk/cases/mysdktest.py

However when placed under.
<my layer>/lib/oeqa/sdk/cases/mysdktest.py
It does not get invoked when running
bitbake <my image> -c testsdk

The testimage scripts do work when placed under
<my layer>/lib/oeqa/runtime/cases/
as they are controlled by the TEST_SUITES variable.

Kindly advise on how to proceed.

Hi Karthik,

Looking at the codes briefly, I would say the reason is that testimage 
considers all BBLAYERS while testsdk does not.

The key codes for testimage are:
testimage.bbclass:get_runtime_paths:
for layer in d.getVar('BBLAYERS').split():
         path = os.path.join(layer, 'lib/oeqa/runtime/cases')
         if os.path.isdir(path):
             paths.append(path)
     return paths

The key codes for testsdk are:
meta/lib/oeqa/sdk/context.py:OESDKTestContextExecutor:
default_cases = 
[os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'cases')]

I think you can fix the codes in sdk/context.py to make it consider 
BBLAYERS just as testimage.bbclass does.

P.S.
I'm not 100% sure, as I did not do any tests.

Regards,
Qi
