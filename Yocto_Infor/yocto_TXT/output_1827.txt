  i note that one of the first sessions is 15 minutes of "A session to
help people setup their Digital Ocean account." would this lab already
be online somewhere so people can do this ahead of time to make sure
nothing goes wrong?

No , we are using a different cloud provider / partner this time. That
requires all the 'students' to have a valid account with our partner
(Digital Ocean), and all the hands on will be done using DO cloud
instances. All registered 'students' will get credits on their Digital
Ocean accounts for the duration of our event.  This first session is to
make sure everyone is all set up with their account before we start the
hands on.

If you don't already have a DO account then signing up ahead of time would
be great.
You can find some info and links at:
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/YoctoProject_Summit_yps2022.05

We were planning on having 3 hands-on classes, but unfortunately one of our
instructors had to drop out and it was too late to find a replacement. Our
first session of the day in that track is Josef doing a live coding
session. Therefore the first hands-on class starts after Josef is done,
which should provide everyone enough time to get accounts and get setup
before the first hands-on event (if they start at the beginning of the
conference day).
