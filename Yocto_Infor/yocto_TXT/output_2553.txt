Is there a particular reason?

My personal build machine has been crashing and dying due to overload
with the default ZSTD_THREADS, and the AB has had problems with xz due
to overload so I was being proactive and ensuring zstd is limited on
the AB the same way xz is.

There was a long thread about this on oe-core recently:

But the AB has not been exhibiting any problems with zstd, and this will
degrade performance. Let's only fix what is broken.

From a different data point, we have clipped the parallelism for XZ
and ZSTD internally to very low ( 2 and 4 )
and it has in fact reduced unexpected failures and seen no impact on
build performance. Since parallelism settings
are myopic for these tools, they greedily take every CPU which is not
best for overall build thats doing many
things in parallel, so its best to curtail them to a conservative value.
