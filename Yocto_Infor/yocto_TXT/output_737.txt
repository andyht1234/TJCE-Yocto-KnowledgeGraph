Hi!
Because hardware acceleration of drawing on laptop with radeon GPU
gives poor results
I am asking if adding libGLX support (and how) to build images would
help? Or something else?

Here is what I added to conf/local.conf at latest poky:
IMAGE_INSTALL += "mesa-demos"
DISTRO_FEATURES:append = "x11 x11-base hwcodecs opengl glx"

But no success to have library linked with libGLX.

I've checked installed images that have radeon firmware files, with
lsmod also see amdgpu and radeon modules.

Best regards,
  Tadej
