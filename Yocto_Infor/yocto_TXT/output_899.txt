Hi All

I am trying to build an application using POSIX on Ubuntu (Yocto 4.1.2).
Even if the development host environment required for the build has been changed to an OS other than Ubuntu, is it possible to build by only changing the Yocto configuration file without changing the application source?

Thanks
Yudai

Yocto first builds its own toolchain, then uses the toolchain to build
the actual software stack for the target. So the host environment can
be any Linux distribution.

If you can say what the other OS is, we can discuss specifically if
it's going to work.

Thanks for reply

Will it work if I use Fedora, CentOS, AlmaLinux, Debian, OpenSUSE?

We support most of them, yes. See
