Greetings !

I am working on NXP's i.MX6UL SoC . I have built yocto successfully for the same . I want to use to my own custom linux kernel source which is cloned in my local PC in some specific directory (suppose in Desktop) , without using default kernel source installed during the yocto compilation .

I tried adding the below lines in "local.conf" file but it is not working . Please help me out to achieve the same.

BRANCH_pn-linux-imx += "v5.0"
SRC_URI_pn-linux-imx += "git:///${HOME}/Desktop/linux;branch=${BRANCH}"
SRCREV_pn-linux-imx += "${AUTOREV}"

Thanks
