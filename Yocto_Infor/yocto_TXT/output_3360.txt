This statement was refering to core-image-minimal.  The board does get
working ethernet, usb, hdmi with core-image-base, the only major devices
not handled are audio (not even hdmi-audio by default) and emmc (see
below).

I realize now that this part is problematic:
- booting core-image-minimal from sdcard with or without an eMMC
plugged indeed works, as does core-image-base without an eMMC
- booting core-image-base from sdcard with an eMMC plugged gets the sd
as mmcblk1

This seems to indicate that upstream dts lacks "/aliases/mmc*"
statements in the dts, I'll have to dig and see
what the proper aliases should be.
