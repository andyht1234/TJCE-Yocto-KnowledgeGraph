The install task runs after the software has been built. It is therefore 
expected your changes aren't actually taken into account.

c.f. https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/tasks.html#do-install, I 
guess it is not THAT obvious that it happens after compilation. Maybe a 
patch to the documentation would help clear things out.

You shouldn't need to modify the makefile and just add "-g" to 
TARGET_CFLAGS/ TARGET_CXXFLAGS or CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS in your recipe.

Also, I have never used it but we do have support for debuginfod which 
should make it easier to debug remotely without installing the binary 
with debug symbols, c.f. 
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/common-tasks.html#debugging-with-the-gnu-project-debugger-gdb-remotely

Cheers,
Quentin

Unless clinfo is doing something wrong, it will be built with -g anyway.  You’ll just need to install clinfo-dbg to get the symbols, as they’ll be split out into a separate package during packaging.

I will need to test but, that appears to have done the trick...
