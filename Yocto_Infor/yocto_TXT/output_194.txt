I have two yocto recipes.

base image and advanced image.

base image have support for dm-verity. i just have to include one line in local.conf to enable dm-verity with initramfs support.

*DISTRO_FEATURES_append += "dm-verity" (creating wic image only)*

*
* and image gets loaded successfully as follows.

But when i am trying to replicate it for advanced image, i am getting kernel panic error as follows.

What could be the issue??

*How to resolve it?*
