I am trying to run tc commands, specifically tc qdisc add dev ppp0 root netem delay 2000ms to add network latency so I can check that things at least won't break when network connection is poor

whenever I run that command I get:

*RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported*

I have the following in my kernel defconfig (tried several combinations with parts of them, these options are taken from 3 sources who all say to enable different config options for tc for some reason):

I figured out why it isn't working when I finally managed to figure out how to check what kernel parameters the kernel was built with (/proc/config.gz); those configuration options are not actually a part of the kernel configuration, though I haven't been able to figure out why

as part of the do_configure step my defconfig (including those parameters) is copied to .config and this works correctly; but then if I run do_compile those configuration options (as well as several others) are removed from .config; though I haven't been able to find out how that happens; as far as I can tell the do_compile just runs kernel_do_compile which just does something like "oe_runmake Image CC="$SOME_FLAGS_FOR_CROSS_COMPILER" $LOADADDR_COMMAND" and then makes dtbs

any ideas why the configuration set in .config is not being used?

well now I feel dumb; I figured out the problem; all those lines like:

# CONFIG_NET_SCHED is not set

are not comments (even if code highlighting thinks they are), they unset the settings, once I removed that from my defconfig it works
