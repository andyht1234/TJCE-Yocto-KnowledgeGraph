Key Status/Updates:

   -

   We are now at feature freeze for 4.3.
   -

   YP 4.2.3 was released
   -

   The qemupcc issue was tracked down to the glibc 2.38 included in the new
   uninative version. Upgrading along the glibc stable branch appeared to
   resolve the issue. It seems ppc was worst affected as the emulation is slow.
   -

   We’re hoping to have tracked down the numpy reproducibility issue to
   non-deterministic blas library queries but we didn’t definitively work out
   which system was introducing the issue so we can’t be sure it is resolved.
   -

   We need to upgrade to qemu 8.1.0 for security fixes but it is broken for
   x86. If we backport fixes for that issue, mips virtio breaks. We’ve filed a
   bug upstream: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1866
   -

   Patches have been resubmitted to radically alter the do_unpack process
   for license compliance reasons. The code is complex and hard to understand
   and will have a performance impact on builds as well as making things hard
   to debug. The risk of not taking the changes is that for some legal
   departments, the SPDX data isn’t detailed enough. The compromise between
   performance and ease of use vs. legal requirements is a tough one. We don’t
   really want to have two codepaths either. Feedback/review on the series
   welcome.
   -

   We continue to see intermittent ptest failures for glib-networking and
   openssh, help would be much appreciated.
   -

   Due to the number of issues related to mips and ppc being encountered
   with few people interested in helping fix them, we are likely to reduce the
   amount of testing being done on those targets before release. If you’re
   using these targets please let us know as we’re likely to drop them if
   there are no users.
   -

   M3 will build when we have a resolution to the qemu 8.1.0 issue and
   ideally fixes for the intermittent ptest issues.
   -

   We’re happy to be able to announce that some of the work in the RFQ will
   now be progressing, specifically that:
   -

      Marta Rybczynska will be working on the security topic
      -

      Alexander Kanvin will be working on the core workflow topic
      -

      Savoir-faire Linux will be working on the toaster and VSCode topics
      -

      BayLibre will be working on the patchtest and project tooling topics
      -

      Michael Opdenacker (Bootlin) will be working on the binary distro
      topic

The other remaining topic areas should be announced soon.

We’d also note that Tim Orling (Konsulko) will be working on the layer
index.

Ways to contribute:

   -

   As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which
   are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to
   keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool,
   toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many
   have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
   components!
   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.

   We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
   appreciated.
