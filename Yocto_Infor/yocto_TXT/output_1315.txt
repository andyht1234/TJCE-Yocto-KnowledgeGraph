Hello All,

I have a simple recipe in which a binary is installed to /usr/bin/. Now, I want to establish a symlink to same binary also. I am using hardknott release

do_install () {
install -d ${D}${bindir}/
install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/test.sh ${D}${bindir}/test
lnr ${D}/usr/bin/test ${D} /usr/bin/test-x
}

Is this the correct approach? Or is there any better method?

Looks ok perhaps you want to double check using lnr we have dropped
its usage in master but I am not sure if hardknott needs it or not. I
would simily use

ln -sf test ${D}/usr/bin/test-x

and avoid using the lnr wrapper.
