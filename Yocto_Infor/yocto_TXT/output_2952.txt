Hi,

I'm trying to add a recipe for:
https://github.com/bootlin/libva-v4l2-request package. This library
heavily depends on actual kernel headers (see
PR.https://github.com/bootlin/libva-v4l2-request). I've bumped kernel
to 5.14-rc7 nad in recipe I'm trying to use what is suggested:

# This is how linux-libc-headers says to include custom uapi headers
CFLAGS_append += " -I ${STAGING_KERNEL_DIR}/include/uapi -I
${STAGING_KERNEL_DIR}/include "
do_configure[depends] += "virtual/kernel:do_shared_workdir"

Problem is that I see a lot of errors like:
kernel-source/include/linux/cache.h:6:10: fatal error: asm/cache.h: No
such file or directory
|     6 | #include <asm/cache.h>

or
recipe-sysroot/usr/include/bits/stdint-intn.h:27:19: note: previous
declaration of 'int64_t' was here
|    27 | typedef __int64_t int64_t;

I tried to compile this package manually on the host only difference
is that I used headers from 5.14 by make headers_install and
everything compiled fine. Any ideas on how to fix this issue?

Thanks and BR,

marek
