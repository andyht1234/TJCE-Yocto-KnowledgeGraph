Hi all,
I am looking for ways for enrollment of secure boot keys from systemd-boot. I am currently on Yocto Kirkstone which is bringing systemd v250. However secure boot keys enrolment support is not available in this version. Patches for this started landing from v252 onwards and for comprehensive functionality one has to be on v254. I tried back porting relevant patches to v250 but the churn on this project so high that it is not practically possible to bring the change as .patch files.

Considering the longevity of Kirkstone, is it possible to migrate systemd to v254? IfÂ not what are the practically possible ways to bring this feature to v250? Due to product requirements I can't move to a newer yocto version.

Any help in this regard is highly appreciated.

Best Regards,
Viswanath

LTS  yocto releases do not get major version upgrades per policy.

You can copy the 254 recipe into a product layer as a backport
perhaps? Note that such backports are often tricky, and you may run
into significant compatibility issues.

Another (better) option is to set up master builds which have the new
systemd version, keep them in sync with yocto upstream, and when the
new LTS is out in about 6 months, you can upgrade your products to use
that.
