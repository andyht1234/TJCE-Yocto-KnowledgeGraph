A not so well-known feature of the WIC bootimg-partition plugin is that 
it can install files into different partitions. For that the variable 
IMAGE_BOOT_FILES has to be defined as one of the following:

IMAGE_BOOT_FILES_label-<partlabel> = "..."

IMAGE_BOOT_FILES_uuid-<partuuid> = "..."

The plugin will then use either the partition label or the partition 
uuid from the WKS file "part" directive to look up the correct file list 
variable.

This code snippet from the plugin 
(poky/scripts/lib/wic/plugins/source/bootimg-partition.py) is supposed 
to do the trick:

 >>>>>

  50         boot_files = None
  51         for (fmt, id) in (("_uuid-%s", part.uuid), ("_label-%s", 
part.label), (None, None)):
  52             if fmt:
  53                 var = fmt % id
  54             else:
  55                 var = ""
  56
  57             print('var: ', var)
  58
  59             boot_files = get_bitbake_var("IMAGE_BOOT_FILES" + var)
  60             if boot_files is not None:
  61                 break

<<<<<

However, the function get_bitbake_var() from 
poky/scripts/lib/wic/misc.py uses the the WIC environment which is 
created from the WICVARS variable by the 
poky/meta/classes/image_types_wic.bbclass. WICVARS is defined at the 
beginning of the class and contains all bitbake variables relevant to 
WIC. It of course includes the plain IMAGE_BOOT_FILES. When the class 
creates the environment (do_rootfs_wicenv) is simply splits WICVARS and 
looks up the variables one-by-one in the DataSmart dictionary 
(d.getVar(<varname>). Since this is a key lookup it will not match any 
variables for IMAGE_BOOT_FILES_label-<partlabel> and/or 
IMAGE_BOOT_FILES_uuid-<partuuid>.

For this to work there should be a lookup in DataSmart that supports 
getVar() with a wildcard or "starts with". I am not all into the details 
of DataSmart and maybe there is something like this already and I just 
don't know about it. Hence the question here before I start hacking a 
kludge into the image_types_wic class.

Thanks,

Rudi
