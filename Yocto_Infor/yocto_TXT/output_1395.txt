Key Status/Updates:

*	4.1 M3 rc2 passed QA except for one issue from M2 we believed fixed
but which isn't.. We'll likely aim to fix that in M4 and release rc2 for M3
(pending TSC approval).
*	Last week was quieter as many people were in Dublin for ELC-E.
Thanks in particular to all who presented or otherwise helped with the booth
or other events there.
*	We've seen a good reduction in CVEs in dunfell and kirkstone but
master is still concerning. A number of the CVEs there have been reported
for version constraint issues to NIST.        
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:

*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:

ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
