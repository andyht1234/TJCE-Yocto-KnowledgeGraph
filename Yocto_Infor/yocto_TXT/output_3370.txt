Hello Folks,

In order to continue to develop my:
https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/bbb-yocto

And advance to yocto hardknott, I did the temporary moves:

Cloned both jumpnow repos to my github space:
https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/meta-bbb
https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/meta-jumpnow

So far, I did only the framework job creating hardknott branches, to
be able to commence.

I'll try to advance meta-bbb with some recent kernels (5.12) in the near Future.

I hope Scott Ellis will return to continue to maintain his repos, but
in the meantime...

Zee
