Key Status/Updates:

   -

   YP 4.3 M2 was released.
   -

   YP 3.1.27 was rebuilt after a toolchain tests fix and is in QA
   -

   YP 4.0.12 rc1 was built but will need to be rebuilt due to an
   autobuilder failure due to certificate expiration.
   -

   The merged systemd upgrade has destablised the autobuilder. We don’t
   want to revert the upgrade but the regressions are causing multiple test
   failures and this along with other issues in multiple patch series means
   patch merging is effectively stalled.
   -

   There are two issues blocking the 6.4 kernel upgrade, one is qemuarm drm
   boot errors and the second is broken networking for systemd images under
   qemu.
   -

   Support for a  new recipe sanity testing task (do_recipe_qa) was merged
   and there is a hope/plan to move more “processing” operations over to this
   task to improve general parsing time.
   -

   CVE metrics are worrying with significant numbers of open CVEs against
   master, many of them kernel related. The 6.4 upgrade should help but that
   is blocked. Mickledore is also badly affected with a record high count.

Ways to contribute:

   -

   As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which
   are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to
   keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool,
   toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many
   have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
   components!
   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
