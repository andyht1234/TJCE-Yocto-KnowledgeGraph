Hi,

I have a .inc file that contains this information:

# Set the MACHINE string, expected to eventually replace the long list of
# build settings below
EXTRA_OECMAKE += "-DRDK_MACHINE=${@d.getVar('MACHINE', False)} "

# Set the region and platform type (defaults to Xi6 and UK)
EXTRA_OECMAKE_append_xione-uk = " -DRDK_PLATFORM=XI1 -DREGION=UK "
EXTRA_OECMAKE_append_xione-us = " -DRDK_PLATFORM=XI1 -DREGION=UK "

EXTRA_OECMAKE_append_llama-uk = " -DRDK_PLATFORM=LLAMA -DREGION=UK "
EXTRA_OECMAKE_append_llama-us = " -DRDK_PLATFORM=LLAMA -DREGION=UK "

I understand that the append lines add extra parameters to the make call. How does Yocto know which platform to use? I mean how does it choose xione-uk or llama-us for instance?

Plus is there a variable that captures the target name, i.e. "xione-uk", "xione-us", etc?

You are building for a specific machine (MACHINE in your local.conf or 
via command line argument for example), so Yocto definitely knows it.

Then your machine configuration file (the one in the form of 
<machinename>.conf contains multiple MACHINEOVERRIDES in .inc files 
which define "families" under which your machine could be matched.

Since MACHINEOVERRIDES is part of OVERRIDES variable which is used to 
filter some variables "overrides", it'll just work (e.g. 
EXTRA_OECMAKE_append_<machinename>).

Hope this helps,
Cheers,
Quentin

Hi Iggy,

Please keep the mailing list in copy.

You tell Yocto to build for a specific MACHINE (this is the name of the 
variable) either from the command line when calling bitbake or in your 
local.conf file in build/conf.

MACHINE is the filename without the extension where the configuration is 
located. e.g. xione-uk MACHINE definition will be in some layer in 
conf/machine/xione-uk.conf.

Cheers,
Quentin

Makes sense. Thanks for your help.
