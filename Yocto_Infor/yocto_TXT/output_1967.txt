Hi all,

I'm on Dunfell [1] and just can't get LICENSE_CREATE_PACKAGE [2] to work right. I'd like to use it to get 'os-release-lic' onto my image. I don't want to install the license packages of *all* the packages onto my image, hence I'm setting NO_RECOMMENDATIONS [3] as well.

[1] https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/?h=dunfell&id=b41d4e46d30ed32e11d68466721a0f4056bad700
[2] http://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-LICENSE_CREATE_PACKAGE
[3] http://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-NO_RECOMMENDATIONS

Both LICENSE_CREATE_PACKAGE = "1" and NO_RECOMMENDATIONS = "1" are set in my local.conf.

Symptom: Bitbake errors out saying nothing RPROVIDES 'os-release-lic'. Sometimes the package DOES appear in `oe-pkgdata-util list-pkgs` though. This seems to depend on whether I issue a build between adding LICENSE_CREATE_PACKAGE and adding os-release-lic, or do both together without an intermediate build.

Has anyone any idea what's going on here? Does it work on your projects?

As a start, where do oe-pkgdata-util and bitbake get their info regarding available packages from? How can come to different results?

Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Manuel
