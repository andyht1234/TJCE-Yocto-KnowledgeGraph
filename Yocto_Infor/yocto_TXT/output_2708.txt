Hi list,

I'm facing an issue with a BSP I created using dunfell (up-to-date on
poky and oe). I'm using a stable kernel and u-boot 2021.07 from denx's
mainline-stable-layer.

I stripped down my machine.conf and basically the boot is working fine.
Was working fine.

When finally I created a functional defconfig (one which didn't strip
down the kernel next to nothing - thanks to KCONFIG_MODE="alldefconfig"
). I started to create fragments to remove unused parts.

The very first fragment I created was leading to rootfs which crashed
at the moment when /sbin/init was invoked, with the strangest errors
I've ever seen:

  /sbin/init: error while loading shared libraries: libkmod.so.2:
  cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Of course libkmod.so.2 (and its target) is present.

Then I realized that no modules where installed in the rootfs. (modules
are there if I don't have the fragment)

So I added kernel-modules to IMAGE_INSTALL:append .

The modules appeared, but the panic still occurred.

What can I do to understand what's going on? I diff'ed the rootfs, the
only difference I could was in ldconfig's aux-cache.

Thanks for any help in advance,
--
Patrick.
