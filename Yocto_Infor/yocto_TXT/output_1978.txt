Key Status/Updates:

*	The next release, kirkstone will be 4.0 (previously known as 3.5)
and will be bitbake 2.0 based.
*	The first release candidate build for YP 4.0 (3.5) is in QA but has
at least one issue which will mean we need a second release candidate build.
We will build that after the final QA report is back.
*	YP 3.3.6, the final hardknott release will build after 4.0 rc2.
*	There are several issues which have arisen in the last week which
mean we will need a second release candidate build:

*	edgerouter didn't boot with rc1 due to a kernel patch issue
*	uninative didn't work with libstdc++ from gcc 12 so we have an
upgraded version
*	there were several CVE fixes that came in (libarchive, gzip, xz)
*	a key intermittent autobuilder fix was identified

Not all of these were release blockers but together they mean an rc2 is
appropriate.

*	If anyone is aware of other issues in rc1 that need to be addressed
in rc2, please let us know ASAP.
*	YP 4.1 planning document is available for review at:
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-g7DatSdmIETwD3xFSCxV7MbWVVkpQvQ788mIr1
MPTI/edit?usp=sharing>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-g7DatSdmIETwD3xFSCxV7MbWVVkpQvQ788mIr1M
PTI/edit?usp=sharing
*	If people see intermittent issues in their own builds, particularly
if they're the same as intermittent issues seen on the autobuilder, please
do comment in the bugs mentioning when they happen as the frequency
information does help us prioritize fixing the most common issues.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at high levels and help is very
much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of failures
we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We did work out the cause of the infamous tinfoil wait_event intermittent
issue.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
