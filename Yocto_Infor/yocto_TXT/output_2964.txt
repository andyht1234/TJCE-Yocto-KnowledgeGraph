Using dunfell 3.1.8

Will post this inquiry while doing my own investigation. When outputting to the debug console that involves standard input(ex. busctl, systemctl status), the output seems misaligned and dirty.
But I noticed this can be easily fixed by adding to the "tools-sdk" to the EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES.
I'm curious to know what else tools-sdk seems to besides adding development tools(ex. gcc,make)

Below is the snapshot when tools-sdk isn't included in the image built
