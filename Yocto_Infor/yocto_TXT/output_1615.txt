Greetings !

I am working on NXP's i.MX6UL SoC and I have successfully built a Read-only Rootfile system through Yocto.
Now I am having a requirement of making only "/etc" as Read & Writable .
So , Can any one suggest me the procedure for making only "/etc" directory as Read & Writable and by keeping rest (/usr , /lib , /bin , ..) as Read-only  through Yocto .

Thanks in Advance

This seems like a good use for overlayfs-etc IMAGE_FEATURES? c.f. 
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/features.html#image-features
See 
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/classes.html#overlayfs-etc-bbclass 
on how to configure it.

This seems to have been added in Kirkstone (4.0) release.

Cheers,
Quentin
