I am using dunfell.

In the documentation I see:

https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual.html#unsetting-variables

In case some filter removes the yocto URL, I am referring to:

    docs/current/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual.html#unsetting-variables

Which has this example:

    unset do_fetch[noexec]

If I put this in my image recipe, the do_fetch noexec item still exists.

In order to fix this problem I had to patch openembedded-core/meta/classes/image.bbclass, and remove the line setting do_fetch[noexec]="1" and the ones following.

I need to do a fetch for my IMAGE_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND.


Thanks.

 From first glance, I'd guess that the approach is just not correct. If 
that thing to be fetched also needs to go *into* the image: make it a 
recipe on its own. If you only need it during build time, then it should 
probably be a -native dependency, and therefore again a recipe on its 
own. Then the image recipe can depend on it and use its contents during 
the build/postprocess stage.

Thanks for your great help.  A native recipe is what I needed with data in it only.  So my native recipe copies files into ${D}${datadir}/${PN}.

Then my image build uses DEPENDS= to bring in the native recipe.

Then my IMAGE_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND can reference ${STAGING_DATADIR_NATIVE}/[native recipe name] to find the data it needs.

Then I don't need to patch the bbclass file.
