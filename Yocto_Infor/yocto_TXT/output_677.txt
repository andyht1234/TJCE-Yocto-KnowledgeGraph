Hi,

Is it possible to make a .bbappend file/method for virtual/kernel of general linux-kernel recipe? My goal is to make some same append script for several BSP linux kernel recipe. For example i like to make an append for linux-xlnx.bb and linux-fslc.bb and so on for all linux-*.bb recipes with some further bash scripts/taskses in a general single bbappend. Is it possible somehow in BitBake/Yocto?

This would require bappends for all kernel recipes you are wanting to append.

Common functionality can be kept in a bbclass, so that the appends must
simply make your recipe inherit the class.

Yes, exactly, i would like to make a bappends for all kernel recipes. Is it possible? Is it possible to somehow make an append for bbclass of the kernel recipes?
