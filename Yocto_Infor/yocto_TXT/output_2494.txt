After the commit [1] introduced in openembedded-core layer,
some configure options is't carried over include xshmfence
option, so remove the xshmfence configure option to silence
the below warning.
  WARNING: xserver-xorg-2_21.1.1-r0 do_configure: QA Issue: xserver-xorg: invalid PACKAGECONFIG: xshmfence [invalid-packageconfig]

That’s ok to remove it but more importantly does it work now without this
option

First we should keep consistent with the change with 
openembedded-core(https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/commit/?id=e05abd87ee5d23750c641d0129d9c83db68ee2e8) 
and also not found any issue related to this option until now.

Thanks,

Looked into xserver's meson.build: As soon as dri3  is added - which
we do - libxshmfence turns into a mandatory dependency. So this patch
is correct.
Somehow libxshmfence is added to sysroot - maybe we should add it
explicitly to dri3 PACKAGECONFIG in oe-core to be more explicit.

Slightly off-topic but we are on xserver on Raspi: Has anybody tested
xserver recently? I see nasty issues on raspi4-64 / XFCE (haven't
tried other desktops yet):

* As soon as a window is opened, screen turns black for 1-2 seconds.
Have not yet found helpful in logs yet.
* There are two mouse devices detected with name 'vc4'. What?

Cheers

Andreas
