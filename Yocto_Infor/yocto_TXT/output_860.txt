matchbox-panel was intended to be GPLv2+ licensed, however the wrong GPL
fragment was added in startup/startup.c in the original import which
stated it was GPL v2 only, and that was copied into startup-notify.

The code that this was based on, mb-applet-startup-monitor, is MIT
licensed[1] so this change isn't a problem.
