Hello All

I want to apply similar kernel version rt-patch in my rpi-basic-image for my raspberrypi4-64 machine. So, I tried to apply rt-patch for a standard rasbian image (5.15.61-v8+) but not got success. i did the following things.

1. I downloaded required kernel sources from the kernel building instructions ( Raspberry Pi Documentation - The Linux kernel) ( https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building )
2. I downloaded https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.15/older/patch-5.15.65-rt49.patch.gz ( https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.15/older/patch-5.15.65-rt49.patch.xz )
cd linux
3. zcat patch-5.15.65-rt49.patch.gz | patch -p1
But after rebooting my pi i am not able to see the patched kernel. I was about to do the same process with my rpi-basic-image. Can anyone tell me what things I am doing wrong?
Or please tell me the standard way of rt-patching the kernel through yocto .

Any reply would be highly appreicated. Thanks in Advance.

Hi,
After applying the patch to the source, I suppose you built the kernel (and
is just missing in your email) ? If not that is a quite important step
missing ;)

Besides that:
1) preempt-rt patch is often very kernel version specific, while I see your
two version don't exactly match: didn't it report any error? (would be
lucky, but possible)
2) You would need also to configure the kernel to enable then the
PREEMPT-RT and so on (this of course between applying the patch and
rebuilding the kernel)
3) And of course then install the new generated image instead of the old
one in a fashion of your choice

Cheers,
Federico
