Hi,

I'm trying to update some artifact after image is build using wic tool.
I've tried wic rm image.wic:2/boot/uImage and this works fine (verified
with wic ls). While when I want to copy something to ext4 partition (I've
tried to copy to vfat boot partition and it works fine) like:
wic cp uImage_modified image.wic:2/boot and verify with wic ls file is not
copied. Anything I'm missing here? Thanks.

BR,

marek

Hmm seems that if I remove file first then it works fine. No idea why it
works with vfat though.

Hi,
how did you solve this? <br>
I have a multi-partion *.wic file and if I copy to part4 (vfat) it is fine. <br>
But if I try to copy to part3 (ext4) then it fails ... which I can see with `ls`. <br>
If I try to copy a complete folder `srv` like: <br>
`wic cp ~/GIT/nfp/buildo/tmp/additional_data/srv ~/GIT/nf75p/buildo/xxx.wic:3/`
... then a `srv` is created which looks like this:
```
wic ls ~/GIT/nfp/buildo/xxx.wic:3/srv
debugfs 1.45.5 (07-Jan-2020)
-l: Ext2 inode is not a directory
```
I can delete this with :
`wic ls ~/GIT/nfp/buildo/xxx.wic:3/srv`
... but I cannot copy anything inside and also the original content from `srv` is not inside.

I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 and also tried it in a docker with Ubuntu 16.04.

Any know issues here or what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks a lot
Markus

Not sure if it helps but as stated in the original response you need to
delete the item first in wic then you can copy. No idea why though ;)

Hi Marek,

thx for your answer but partition 3 is completely empty, so nothing can be deleted here ... <br>
Is there a special option needed in the *.wks.in file to be able to copy something with `wic`?

Cheers,
Markus

I am having a similar problem with `wic cp` and ext4. Though, my problem is
a file cannot be copied to a specific path with `wic cp <src>
<image>:<part><path>. No matter what I put, the file gets put at the root.

```
$ wic cp test ./my.wic:1/etc/
$ wic ls test ./my.wic:1/etc/
.
..
$ wic ls ./my.wic:1
.
..
/etc
test
```

I am unsure if this is related, but I thought I'd mention it since I am
experiencing issues with the same command.

Logan

Hi Logan,

I think this is the same problem.<br>
Has anyone of you tried to use this "-n" or "--native-sysroot <path>" parameter like here?: <br>
`wic cp <src> <dest-image>:<partition><path> --native-sysroot <path>` <br>
In my YOCTO build I see that e.g. `mtools` and `parted` are also built. <br>
So I tried these but do not see a difference.<br>

My suspicion is, that the interworking between the `wic`-python script and the external used tools has somehow a problem. Perhaps it works only with specific versions. <br>
It is sad that no errors/warnings are shown which could lead to an answer.<br>

Cheers,
Markus

Hi,

now it is clear why it doesn't work.
`wic` uses `debugfs` to write things to ext? partitions.
But `debugfs` (1.45.4 (23-Sep-2019)) can only write to the current working directory and it cannot copy complete directory trees (like mtools's `mcopy` can do for FAT like file systems).

So the only way I see to achieve this is to write a command list which is given to `debugfs` via `-f`parameter.
Such a command list may look like this for command `debugfs -w single_partition_file -f command_list` :
``` 
cd "/dirX"
rm "file1"
cd "/"
rmdir "dirX"
cd "/"
mkdir "dirX"
cd "/dirX"
write "/home/myuser/my_local_file1" "file1"
```

The remove is done because `debugfs`cannot overwrite files!

I hope this helps others with same problem ... :-)

Cheers,
Markus
