Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.1 M3 was released
*	YP 4.0.4 was released
*	We're seeing good improvements in the CVE counts, thanks to all who
have been contributing.
*	For 4.1 final release (officially due to build next Monday), things
do seem to have been stabilizing and we have resolved or are close to
resolving the critical issues we have the capacity to resolve.  Before we
end up with more CVEs or more bug reports, we're therefore aiming to go
ahead with the release ASAP. As such, if anyone has things they think should
block release, please let us know.
*	After the release build Richard is planning to disappear for a
couple of weeks so things will slow down accordingly.
*	A tool, used for collaboration on the creation of release notes,
<https://git.yoctoproject.org/git-refinery-web/> git-refinery-web has been
made publicly available by Intel, thanks! We may not be able to use it for
4.1 due to the timescales but the hope is to use it in the future for
collaboratively creating the release notes.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:

*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:

ncements.2FBugs>

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
