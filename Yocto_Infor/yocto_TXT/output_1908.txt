This message is ok for Dunfell (3.1.x) releases. You could also point 
directly to https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dunfell/

For all other releases, use:

This version of the project is now considered obsolete, please select 
and use a <a href="https://docs.yoctoproject.org">more recent version</a>.

body can be modified directly in the css file without using a div. I 
seem to recall you told us something related to the content actually 
overlapping you modifications if body was used without putting it in a 
div? This is the comment we want in there, you explaining why we cannot 
keep body tag but need a div with a body class instead.

Useless comments, please remove.

It is still supported but the files you're looking through are outdated, 
so a different message should be printed. But something should still be 
printed though!

> +        exclude = set(['3.1', '3.1.1', '3.1.2', '3.1.3'])

3.1.4 is still missing. You could just check for any directory whose 
filename is prefixed by 3.1.

Cheers,
Quentin

Hi Quentin,
Thanks for the review.

I tried using regex to look for all the folders prefixed by 3.1. but it is currently not working, But I am still working on a fix for it.
I noticed that the banner was already on the dunfell excluding 3.1.15, so should I hardcode from 3.1 to 3.1.14 while looking for way to make the regex method work?

No need for a regex, just check the root string starts with "./3.1", that's enough.

>I noticed that the banner was already on the dunfell excluding 3.1.15, so should I hardcode from 3.1 to 3.1.14 while looking for way to make the regex method work?

Your script will only run on the old docs which stops at 3.1.4. There are no other directories. You can check by yourself in the docbook tarball and/or by exiting the run-docs-build script right after calling your script. Therefore, there's really nothing fancy in handling 3.1 except having a different message than for <3.1 releases.

Cheers,
Quentin
