If I have one HW platform but two images, where the latter one contains a bit more applications, am I supposed to have one MACHINE, one DISTRO and 2 IMAGES? Or maybe one IMAGE but somehow to define IMAGE_FEATURES / EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES differently in those two cases? Due to simplicity, I would rather have one image recipe.

If the packages that are in both images are compiled identically, with 
the same options, etc... then two images. Recipes are the least invasive 
in terms of Yocto builds so if you can avoid different distribution or 
machine files, try to do so, your build times will thank you for it :)

If it's only a few additional packages, I recommend your image-extended 
recipe to include/require the image-simple recipe and then just add an
IMAGE_INSTALL += "additional-packages" in there. Super easy to maintain 
and read.

Cheers,
Quentin
