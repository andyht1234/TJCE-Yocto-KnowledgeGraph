Enable the vcc3v0_sd regulator on boot so that the device can boot from the
uSD card (when using certain uSD cards).

+Subject: [PATCH] rk3399-nanopi4.dtsi: enable sdmmc regulator on boot
+
+When trying to boot a nanopi-m4 board with an SDHC-class uSD card, the boot
+comes to a full stop shortly after initializing the mmc subsystem. The boot
+can be cajoled into continuing if, after waiting a minute or so, the uSD
+card is ejected and re-inserted. Waiting a minute or so before ejecting and
+re-inserting the uSD card is crucial since the boot will not continue if
+the card is ejected/re-inserted too soon after the boot has stopped.
+
+The nanopi-m4 has a uSD card and an optional eMMC module, either of which
+can be used for booting. In my case I don't have the optional eMMC module,
+therefore I'm booting from the uSD card. When booting from the uSD card,
+its regulator needs to be enabled at boot.
+
+Curiously, this should have been an issue from day one, but it only started
+to become a problem after commit 98e48cd9283d ("regulator: core: resolve
+supply for boot-on/always-on regulators") was merged. Additionally, by
+coincidence, I happened to be using an SDHC-class card in my device, and
+saw the failure. However, if I use an SDXC-class uSD card the problem does
+not occur.
+
+Much thanks to Mark Brown and Javier Martinez Canillas for their assistance
+on irc!

use of override here seems unnecessary
