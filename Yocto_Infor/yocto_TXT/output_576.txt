patchtest's method of mounting a shared directory into the guest image
means that the associated content may not be owned by the image's user.
Add /home/patchtest/openembedded-core and
/home/patchtest/openembedded-core/bitbake to the patchtest user's
.gitconfig so that it can still run tests if the provided repo is owned
by someone else.
