Ok thank you for your fast answer, I was wondering why this is not the case for the most Snort 2 rules.

I computed the same MD5 hash sum as on the website:

¬∑        ‚Äú9bf94aa54566829c35a9aa64e89f3345‚Äù for snortrules-snapshot-31470.tar.gz



Kind regards

I believe this is normal, since AV detections based on signatures can trigger alert when they see pattern in Snort Rules. I had this alert earlier, it would help to create a folder and exclude that from defender scans. Also, verify the checksum of the file downloaded from Snort, just to be on safe side.

Thanks,
Jayesh

Subject: [Snort-sigs] Snort 3 rules - Antivirus


Dear Snort community,



I recently registered to be able to download the Snort 3 rules. Unfortunately, when downloading, Windows defender started complaining that a Virus was detected. Is this normal behavior or am I currently being attacked üòÉ?



Kind regards



Gerry
