Hi all,

I have a recipe that is built only with the SDK that modifies the content of an existing file in the rootfs by doing "install -m 644 ${WORKDIR}/my_file ${D}${sysconfdir}/my_file" but this command is returning next error:

Error: Transaction check error:
  file /etc/my_file between attempted installs of my_recipe-1.0-r0.7.armv7ahf_neon and initial_script-1.0-r155.1.armv7ahf_neon

I have seen that the best practice to modify an existing file is to create a .bbappend but this modification would be done for all builds, not only for the SDK. So what would be the best way to do this?

Regards.
Jose

You can do this with a postinst scriptlet, or with an image post
processing task, but generally this looks like a hack regardless of
how you do it. What is the file for, and why does it need to be
replaced?

Yes, indeed. It's a hack to be able to run some tests. Does the "image post processing task" that you comment related with SDK_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND?

Regards.

I'd say it's better to modify the original recipe, can you do that?

I can't. The file that i'm trying to modify is a configuration file of a service that is built with its recipe and in my "optional" recipe what i'm trying to do is change a parameter of that configuration file.

Then you should look at something like ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND,
which runs an extensible set of functions after the rootfs for a
target image has been formed through package install in do_rootfs.
