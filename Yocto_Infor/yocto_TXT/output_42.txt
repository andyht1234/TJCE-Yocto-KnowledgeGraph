From: Trevor Woerner <twoerner@gmail.com>

Unfortunately the TF-A project does not currently have support for
the rk3588. Therefore, for the time-being, the only way to supply a
TPL/DDR-init for the rk3588 is to use the closed-source rkbin binaries
from Rockchip. If/when TF-A adds support for the rk3588 we can investigate
switching.

The rk3588 comes in two variants: rk3588 and rk3588s. The "s" option is a
stripped-down version of the rk3588. In the Linux kernel these two SoCs are
kept separate, with the rk3588 building on the rk3588s, so we've mimicked that
same behaviour here.

^^^ This is actually something we probably need to discuss?

This makes it harder to backport patches from the master branch to 
kirkstone because we have to be careful to rename those variables before 
applying the patch (even if somehow it applies cleanly).

On the other hand, migrating to the new name means we break the current 
behavior for downstream users of meta-rockchip.

Cheers,
Quentin
