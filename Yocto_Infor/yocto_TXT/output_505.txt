In the `b4 shazaam` workflow, you cannot consume patches from AUH emails
because they are sent as attachments. This means a maintainer must first
download the patch from an email or wget it from a lore.kernel.org copied
url.

Before I go implementing something that might be unwanted, is there a
downside to sending AUH generated emails with the patches in the normal
`git send-email` type approach?

AUH attaches not just the patch (if it was possible to produce), but
also buildhistory and build failure logs (if something failed). It
also provides a bit of explanation/context/apply-resend instructions
in the email text. We can certainly consider options, I'm just not
sure how to arrange all that if patches are sent directly as emails.

Note that the whole patchset is also attached as a tarball to overall
AUH status email, and both the tarballs and their content are also
available online:

Thanks, that seems reasonable, but is then it still ok to attach additional
build artifacts (logs etc) to the message? Will the tools first discard the
attachments, take the message body, then apply the scissors to get the
patch out?

I added a tweak to AUH that would do the scissors thingy with the patch:
