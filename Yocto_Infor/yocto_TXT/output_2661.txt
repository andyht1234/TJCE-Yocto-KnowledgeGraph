Hi, 

    We are executing busybox pTests and we see that the test case execution
stops at md5sum test case.

We analyzed and see that the execution gets stuck here
<https://github.com/sailfishos-mirror/busybox/blob/master/testsuite/md5sum.t
ests#L29>  at Line no 29.

 

Below are the relevant code lines:

Line no. 28: text="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Line no. 29: text=`yes "$text" | head -c 9999`

 

I executed above two lines on my host machine and the I get the shell prompt
back but when executed on target machine, I'm not getting the shell prompt,
it gets stuck.

/usr/lib/busybox/ptest # text="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

/usr/lib/busybox/ptest # text=`yes "$text" | head -c 9999`

<<get stuck here indefinitely and I don't get the shell prompt>>

 

I modified Line no. 29 as below (removed " around $text) and the test case
execution proceeds further with "yes: Broken Pipe" error. With the same
modification, I don't see this error on my host machine though.

Line no. 29: text=`yes $text | head -c 9999`

 

/usr/lib/busybox/ptest # text="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

/usr/lib/busybox/ptest # text=`yes $text | head -c 9999`

yes: Broken pipe

 

My host machine uses Bash as my default shell where as my target uses
busybox sh as my default shell. Does this make any difference?

Any pointers on this will be appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Ravi

It’s also good to post your build configuration that bitbake prints at the
beginning of build this could also be other policies like default libc
being musl vs glibc is in play etc
