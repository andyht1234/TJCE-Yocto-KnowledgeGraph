Variables PREFERRED_PYTHON_PATH and PYTHON3_PATH are set with
${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE}. For cross compile, ${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE} may point
to other path rather than standard dir such as /usr/bin. Then the
generated library file contains such path which should NOT. Update to
make variables PREFERRED_PYTHON_PATH and PYTHON3_PATH configurable to
fix buildpaths issue:

| WARNING: openscap-1.3.7-r0 do_package_qa: QA Issue: File
