Hello,

I have some files which I need to install them to a custom partition (to /mnt/custom). But, I couldn't find any installation variables to install files to /mnt/ (partiton other than rootfs).
I want to do something like below:

do_install() {
install -d ${D}$<mnt>/custom
install -m 0755 ${S}/sample.sh ${D}$<mnt>/custom/sample.sh
}

But I think this is not supported or not easily possible.

Can anyone please let me know how to install files to partition other than / ?

Thanks in advance

I think it goes like this.

In your recipe you need to install files into the root directory of
the partition itself and not its mount point, e.g. strip the
mnt/custom prefix.

Then you need to create an image recipe that will install one or more
of the packages that contain the files that should be on the
partition.

Then you can compose a complete 'bundle' containing all the needed
partitions (created from image recipes) that can be written to a disk
of the target device, using wic for example like described here:
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/tree/scripts/lib/wic/canned-wks/directdisk-multi-rootfs.wks?h=master-next

There's a manual for wic too:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev/dev-manual/wic.html

Hello Alex,

Thanks for the update.

I already have a partition created using .wks file. "--label custom" is used here

Do you mean like this below?

do_install() {
install -d ${D}${custom}/
install -m 0755 ${S}/sample.sh ${D}${custom}/sample.sh
}

I am not sure if I understodd below statement fully:

"Then you need to create an image recipe that will install one or more of the packages that contain the files that should be on the partition."

I think addingÂ FILES_${PN} should take care of this, right?

FILES_${PN} = " \
${custom}/sample.sh \
"

Hello,

Update: Tried below approach

do_install() {
install -d ${D}${custom}/
install -m 0755 ${S}/sample.sh ${D}${custom}/sample.sh
}

FILES_${PN} = " \
${custom}/sample.sh \
"

But, getting the error "Files/directories were installed but not shipped in any package"

This is not enough information. To be able to help, I need to see the
complete recipe, the command you are issuing, and the complete error
message that happens. You can simply publish your work in public git
somewhere as well.
