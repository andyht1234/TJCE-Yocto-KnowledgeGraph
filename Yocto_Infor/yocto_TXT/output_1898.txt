hello,


I would like to have a custom DISTRO_VERSION based on "git describe" of my
layer:


1) In my layer meta-mylayer/conf/layer.conf, I defined the following:

# Set variable to get the location of the layer
> MY_LAYER_BASE := '${LAYERDIR}'



2) I created a my_distro_version.bbclass with following:

def my_distro_version(d):
>     import subprocess
>     project_path = d.getVar('MY_LAYER_BASE', True)
>     cmd = "git describe --tags"
>     proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True,
> cwd=project_path)
>     out, err =  proc.communicate()
>     return out.decode("utf-8").rstrip()


3)  Then I inherited it my  meta-mylayer/conf/distro/my_distro.conf :

INHERIT += "my_distro_version"
> DISTRO_VERSION = "${@my_distro_version(d)}"


>

so far so good I can see that DISTRO_VERSION is following the git describe :


NOTE: Resolving any missing task queue dependencies

MACHINE = "beaglebone-yocto"
> DISTRO = "my-distro"
> DISTRO_VERSION = "v1.4-rc14"
> TUNE_FEATURES = "arm vfp cortexa8 neon callconvention-hard"
> TARGET_FPU = "hard"
> meta-mylayer = "HEAD:ca8a5390db5e5280c3b178097ad36900c97160a8"
> meta-swupdate = "HEAD:2e08de8582aa18871657ea8283ea35a050927d4f"
> meta-qt5 = "HEAD:6bfe29d9e8fdd5c2fd17c736814b6df859b3af50"



But I'm getting a lot of errors :



the basehash value changed from
efc66702573a04ced9af3be8902d643f8709969ad8cdf19b822e9bd14910c755 to
d24664027a632185bda9807951586efdf9b9160bb7cef2524d7c9d577cc6f527. The
metadata is not deterministic and this needs to be fixed.
> ERROR: The following commands may help:

and some of the recipes don't get the right  DISTRO_VERSION.

probably a multi processing problem in yocto since I used

INHERIT += "my_distro_version" all recipes will want to execute
DISTRO_VERSION = "${@my_distro_version(d)}".



I didn't find a way to get  DISTRO_VERSION =
"${@my_distro_version(d)}" executed only once!


Any suggestions ?


Thanks

I would also add --always and --dirty to be sure non-tagged clones
of repo work and builds with local modifications get marked as such.

DISTRO_VERSION := "${@my_distro_version(d)}"

That should do it :)

Hi,

thanks for the quick reply I tried your suggestion but I get:

ERROR: Unable to parse Var <DISTRO_VERSION[:=]>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "Var <DISTRO_VERSION[:=]>", line 1, in <module>
bb.data_smart.ExpansionError: Failure expanding variable
DISTRO_VERSION[:=], expression was ${@my_distro_version(d)} which triggered
exception NameError: name 'my_distro_version' is not defined

I think in this case the INHERIT doesn't work !


Best regards,

Did you include the bbclass?

> I think in this case the INHERIT doesn't work !

Well I have in distro config:

require classes/distroversion.bbclass

which has a single python function

def get_distro_version(d, dirty=True, abbrev=None):

which basically calls "git describe --always --dirty --abbrev=8",
the last one was added when git versions started behaving differently
and breaking reproducibility.

And then distro config also has:

DISTRO_VERSION := "${@get_distro_version(d)}"

This works for me up to yocto 3.1 dunfell at least.

Cheers,

-Mikko

I'm also suing dunfell branch, I did a small modification in
my_distro_version.bbclass:

def my_distro_version(d):
>     import subprocess
>     project_path = d.getVar('MY_LAYER_BASE', True)
>     cmd = "git describe --tags"
>     proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True,
> cwd=project_path)
>     out, err =  proc.communicate()
>     return out.decode("utf-8").rstrip()
> MY_DISTRO_VERSION := "${@my_distro_version(d)}"



Then in meta-mylayer/conf/distro/my_distro.conf I used:

> INHERIT += "my_distro_version"
> DISTRO_VERSION := "${MY_DISTRO_VERSION}"


It seems to be working now :-)


Thank you for the support :-)


cheers,

Good! Just a hint that you might want to set SDK_VERSION to the same.
