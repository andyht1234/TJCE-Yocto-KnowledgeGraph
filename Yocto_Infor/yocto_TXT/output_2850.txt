Hi, Richard

Layer Index "https://layers.openembedded.org/" not works since below 
update failure.Â  I don't know who is the maintainer,

Could you help to handle this to proper person? Thanks.

Besides, I am trying to add a funtion that when there are errors, send a 
mail to maintainer, so we can know this failure sooner.

ERROR: Traceback (most recent call last):
