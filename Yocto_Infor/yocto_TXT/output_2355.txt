I need to include an old open source project named judy for a legacy
utility dependency. The recipe I have so far is listed at the end of this email. The
build host is 64bit linux, I'm using dunfell and the MACHINE I'm build for is "genericx86-64".
The issue I'm seeing is when compiling judy, it builds and then executes a
binary named "JudyLTablesGen" as part of the process. However the execution
fails with:

/bin/sh: ./JudyLTablesGen: No such file or directory

The interpreter for JudyLTablesGen is set as: /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2. On
the build host the library doesn't exist under /lib, but does exist as
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2. When I run ldd on JudyLTablesGen I see ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
as:

/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f58fa839000).

A potential workaround to compile it is:

ln -s /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2'

But I'd like to find a way to fix this in the recipe and not have to modify the build host file system. Any advice?

This is a classic problem with software that doesn't consider
cross-compilation (and even when building for a similar architecture,
like genericx86-64 on an x86 host, you're cross-compiling in Yocto).

The makefiles generate a binary that it expects to be able to run.
This is a bad assumption as you're cross-compiling: that binary needs
to be built with the host compiler (BUILD_CC) instead.  However, the
Makefile.am does this:

JudyLTables.c: JudyLTablesGen.c
        $(CC) $(INCLUDES) $(AM_CFLAGS) @CFLAGS@ -o JudyLTablesGen
JudyLTablesGen.c; ./JudyLTablesGen

A non-upstreamable fix would be to simply change that line to
$(BUILD_CC) $(BUILD_CFLAGS) $(BUILD_LDFLAGS) -o JudyLTablesGen [...].
As the project is dead, an upstreamable fix isn't useful.

Whilst I'm here that FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend is redundant, and the
source of Judy looks like fairly typical autoconf so you can remove
your do_configure and just 'inherit autotools', this will also pass
the correct host/build/target flags and so on.

Also note that a more recently maintained fork appears to be at
https://github.com/netdata/libjudy.

Thanks man, I appreciate it. After reading your response, I understood the
issue and was able to create a bunch of patches to mak it work.
