Hi,

Are package feed updates (e.g. deb or rpm) between different yocto
releases (e.g. dunfell and kirkstone) expected to work/supported? I've
tried it briefly and package state differences between the two seem to
be a mess. But still, apt somehow managed to update most of the
packages, but not all.

Thanks,
Ivan

No, it's neither tested nor expected to work between major yocto
releases. In embedded world the typical way to update a system is to
overwrite the whole partition. Some setups use filesystem snapshot
approach like ostree.
