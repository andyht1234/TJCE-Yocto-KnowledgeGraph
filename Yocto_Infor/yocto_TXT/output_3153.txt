Hello,
I see that meta-spdxscanner has been moved to 
http://git.yoctoproject.org, and doesn't maintained on github 
anymore.https://github.com/dl9pf/meta-spdxscanner/issues/21

Therefore the only way to get in contact to developers is writing to this ML

I am trying to understand how meta-spdxscanner works.
I'd like to test it without any external service (no Fossology) 
therefore I am trying the INHERIT += "scancode-tk" approach.

I am testing it with a dunfell version and I noticed a lot of errors so 
I switched to master and the bitbake build started but again I am facing 
to a problem

ERROR: bash-completion-2.10-r0 do_get_report: Could not invoke scancode 
Command

I'd like to have advice from you to understand if is it possible to test 
it without any external service and discover what kind of artefacts are 
generated into deploy/spdx.

Thank you

Yes, you can contact me or contribute to meta-spdxscanner to this ML.

I have not maintained scancode-tk for long time. And recently there are somebody else asked me about scancode-tk.
Yes, I planned to make scancode-tk.bbclass work without external service. But there are always issues because environment.
The problem of scancode-tk.bbclass that scancode must work with specify a version of python(latest requires 3.6), but you know that for YP or your host, it is hard to meet the requirement.
I found the newest version of scancode-tk support running in docker. So I plan to make scancode-tk.bbclass work with scancode command by docker next.
Of course, if you have good ideas, please tell me, or contribute to meta-spdxscanner directlly.

By the way, why not try fossology? It is really good that you can browse the compliance information on fossology server after you get spdx files by bitbake of YP.

Best regards
Lei

Hi Lei,
thank you for answering.

Considering the problems I encounter with scancode-tk and that the 
artifacts it produces are simple text files that need further analysis, 
I was just deciding to migrate to Fossology with "fossology-rest".
The only drawback is having to install the server, but I don't think it 
will be a problem.

Thanks again, I will contact you again if you have any problems with 
this mode.

Best,

Hi Lei,
I tried the latest meta-spdxscanner with a Docker version cof Fossology 
but the entire process fails with errors on the Yocto bitbake side.

I'd like to have a minimal proof of work of this toolkit.
Would you mind sharing the version and the configuration you are using 
successfully (for both meta-spdxscanner and Fossology)?

Thank you
