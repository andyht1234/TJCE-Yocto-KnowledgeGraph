I think i figured out the issue, repo password havingÂ  "=" sigh due to that its throwing below error.

i dont have access to change password in the repo, can someone suggest some ideas on how to resolve this.

you might have to figure out how the clone should work firstly. then
you can either encode it into SRC_URI, but I would say be careful
since you might leak password and url info
into packages, other option is to have some sort of ssh-agent running
and doing the authentication or maybe use .netrc to hold this info on
builder's homedir.
