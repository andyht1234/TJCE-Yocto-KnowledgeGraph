friend asked me about the options for a risc-v dev kit that worked
with YP, and i'm aware of the meta-riscv layer, but wherever i looked,
it seems like risc-v dev kits have a very short life span, being either
put on hold or outright cancelled (beaglev, hifive unmatched, etc.)

are there, in fact, any reasonable risc-v dev boards out there?

I think the best option at this point is qemu. Why does the 'friend' need
physical hardware? :)

   he's a hacker and just likes the feel of circuit boards, but
qemu does look like the only feasible option at the moment.

Hello Robert, Alexander,

No. There is a sweet middle ground called FPGAs. You buy a board, with an
IC on it, that is expensive as hell, empty like air, but fully
re-configurable with almost any RISC-V SoC you can think of.

For example the Rocket 64 bit RISC-V.

Regards, Leon

   hmmm ... not even that expensive a board:
