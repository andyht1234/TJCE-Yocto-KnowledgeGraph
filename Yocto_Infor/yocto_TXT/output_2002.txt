Key Status/Updates:

*	We will build the first release candidate build for YP 4.0 (3.5)
later today.
*	YP 3.4.3 was released
*	YP 3.3.6, the final hardknott release will build after 4.0 rc1.
*	We're planning to take a couple of further changes (pseudo fix, apt
signing minus the test and the unwind sdl workaround) and then call the
first release candidate build good.
*	There were a number of good fixes for memory resident bitbake this
week and also some interesting and useful fixes for the bitbake parsing
process which should avoid lockups in the error case. The hope is these
should avoid some of the intermittent issues we've been seeing on the
autobuilder.
*	An issue with make 4.2.1 on some distros remains, often causing
hangs in kernel and perl builds in particular. Help in developing a
workaround for this (a make buildtools tarball?) would be appreciated.
*	YP 4.1 planning document is available for review at:
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-g7DatSdmIETwD3xFSCxV7MbWVVkpQvQ788mIr1
MPTI/edit?usp=sharing>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-g7DatSdmIETwD3xFSCxV7MbWVVkpQvQ788mIr1M
PTI/edit?usp=sharing
*	If people see intermittent issues in their own builds, particularly
if they're the same as intermittent issues seen on the autobuilder, please
do comment in the bugs mentioning when they happen as the frequency
information does help us prioritize fixing the most common issues.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at high levels and help is very
much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of failures
we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We did work out the cause of the infamous tinfoil wait_event intermittent
issue.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
