I recommend putting your whole python project into a repository (e.g.
with git) and then create a recipe that fetches the git repository and
installs the files to a sensible location.

You should be able to follow the documentation on writing a new recipe
to some degree:

https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#new-recipe-writing-a-new-recipe

To run your script on boot, I would create an init script / systemd
service, depending on what init system your image is using. See here
for more information:
