Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.2 has been released, thanks to everyone who has worked on it!
*	YP 4.1.4 is due to be released
*	YP 3.1.25 is in QA
*	The warnings issues on the autobuilder have mostly been resolved but
there are a number of lingering intermittent issues that we're still working
through.
*	Patches have been merging into master but there continues to be a
number of issues being found in testing which does slow down the process.
*	There are time64 patches being proposed to handle Y2038 issues on 32
bit architectures which likely need further discussion since the compiler
flag changes aren't without risk and potential side effects.
*	The minimum kernel version for OE-Core is now set at 5.15 as part of
the time64 work but also to aid performance.
*	We're aiming to improve documentation as we go along in this
release, please keep this in mind when sending patches!
*	There is a proposal on the bitbake mailing list which would allow
the possibility of layer overrides, which could be useful for some of the QA
checks recently discussed.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components
which are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying
to keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex,
devtool, toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more.
Many have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
components!
*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
*	Help us resolve CVE issues:
<https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/patchmetrics/> CVE metrics 
*	We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.
