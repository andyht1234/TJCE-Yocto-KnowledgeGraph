Hi,

I'm trying to add a rust application to my distro based on kirkstone, and created a recipe with cargo-bitbake.
The build fails with:

    error running rustfmt: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }

I also tried to add the meta-lts-mixins layer - same result.

Any ideas, did I miss something? I'm not really a rust developer.
