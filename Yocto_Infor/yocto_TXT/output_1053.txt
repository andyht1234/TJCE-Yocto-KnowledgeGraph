Good day everyone.

We are in the process of upgrading to langdale, and I ran across a small
problem when building dropbear. The order of external assets in SRC_URI
seems to cause an issue when PAM is not available in DISTRO_FEATURES.

ERROR:
/home/****/yocto/poky-next/build-cyber-v/../meta/recipes-core/dropbear/dropbear_2022.82.bb:
Unable to get checksum for dropbear SRC_URI entry
0007-Fix-X11-build-failure-use-DROPBEAR_PRIO_LOWDELAY.patchfile: file
could not be found

When we move the following entry to the bottom of SRC_URI in
meta/recipes-core/dropbear/dropbear_2022.82.bb, the recipe parses
successfully:

${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'pam', '${PAM_SRC_URI}', '', d)}

Is this a good fix? Am I missing a larger issue?

Claude Bing

try something like below it will remove the positional requirement.

Forgive the text wrapping, but modifying PAM_SRC_URI still yields the
same results. I don't want to take up too much of your time since we
have a workaround, but I figured you would want some feedback.


SRC_URI = "http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/releases/dropbear-${PV}.tar.bz2 \
           file://0001-urandom-xauth-changes-to-options.h.patch \
           file://init \
           file://dropbearkey.service \
           file://dropbear@.service \
           file://dropbear.socket \
           file://dropbear.default \
           ${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'pam',
'${PAM_SRC_URI}', '', d)} \
           ${@bb.utils.contains('PACKAGECONFIG', 'disable-weak-ciphers',
'file://dropbear-disable-weak-ciphers.patch', '', d)} \

file://0007-Fix-X11-build-failure-use-DROPBEAR_PRIO_LOWDELAY.patch"

SRC_URI[sha256sum] =
"3a038d2bbc02bf28bbdd20c012091f741a3ec5cbe460691811d714876aad75d1"

PAM_SRC_URI = "file://0005-dropbear-enable-pam.patch \
               file://0006-dropbear-configuration-file.patch \
               file://dropbear \
               "
