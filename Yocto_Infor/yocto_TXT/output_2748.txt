I am looking at "meta-intel/dynamic-layers/clang-layer/recipes-opencl/compute-runtime"
I have been "told" that this compute-runtime recipe should basically build opencl (Neo) with all the required dependencies...
I did not think Yocto had support for OpenCL, and was looking to build Neo under the SDK.


(1)    Is this true, does meta-intell under zeus now support building OpenCL and the OpenCL Graphics compiler under Yocto ?

(2)    Of so, what would be the proper way to pull this into my yocto build ?

Thanks,
Steve
