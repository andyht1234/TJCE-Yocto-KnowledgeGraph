In addition to the testresult json, testimage class now also
provides task logs and qemu console output (splitted into
folders by image name to avoid clutter), which can be useful
for debugging test failures or even checking qemu test runs
when failures did not happen.

Rather than duplicate specific file/folder names, let's copy all
that is available, and define what is published in the testimage
class itself.

[YOCTO #14518]
