Hello,

I'm building an image for the NUC 11th gen and I'm having issue with the 
nvme.

I have an nvme drive with my image on it, when I insert the nvme drive 
in the m.2 nvme socket I'm having the errors shown it the picture (sorry 
for the reflection). The system is stuck there.

When I use an external nvme to USB adaptor, it will boot even with a few 
ACPI Error: AE_NOT_FOUND warnings.

As you can see in the picture
the NUC model is : NUC11TNBi5
the bios revision is TNTGL357.0057.2021.0609 06/09/2021

I'm using the master branch of meta-intel with the linux-yocto-5.10 
kernel

Any help would be appreciated

Thanks

Simon
