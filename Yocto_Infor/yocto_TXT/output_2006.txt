I'm trying an experiment building yocto/OE on a Raspberry Pi 4 to host 
on the same RP4. Admittedly, a not practical platform for this purpose 
but it should work.

I'm trying to target the ARM ISA for the image using yocto-3.4.2. I've 
tried simply using the default setting and end up with:

_ERROR:  OE-core's config sanity checker detected a potential 
misconfiguration._
_    Either fix the cause of this error or at your own risk disable the 
checker (see sanity.conf)._
_    Following is the list of potential problems / advisories:_
_ _
_    Specified SDKMACHINE value is not valid_

I've tried editing ./conf/local.conf:

MACHINE ?= "qemuarm64"

#MACHINE ??= "qemux86-64"

But this accomplishes nothing. Needless to say, I'm a yacto/OE newbie, 
so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

It’s complaining about SDKMACHINE setting which is a separate variable, can
you check your local.conf if it’s set to something

There's this:
#SDKMACHINE ?= "i686"

OK it should be ok then. Can you describe your steps to setup the system?

are you on a x86_64 host? Secondly try to uncomment SDKMACHINE setting
in local.conf
and see if it helps. Also check if your default shell is bash or dash.

Oh I see. we do support aarch64 as build host, so if you are trying
64bit OS on rpi then it should work
although, rpi4 may not have enough muscle to build, perhaps using SSD
with rpi4 might help a bit

So find out if rpi4 is running in 64bit mode if not then building on
armv7 might have issues.

in anycase try setting SDKMACHINE = "i686" this should get you past
this particular error, there might be more after it.

Fixed when x11 is not in DISTRO_FEATURES:
$ bitbake wxwidgets
ERROR: Nothing PROVIDES 'wxwidgets'
wxwidgets was skipped: missing required distro feature 'x11' (not in
DISTRO_FEATURES)

Is Raspian 32- or 64-bit?  We don't suppose 32-bit arm SDKs.

As Khem said, set SDKMACHINE to i686 explicitly to avoid this.  Note
that compiling on a RPi4 is *very slow*.

NEWBIE question!

I tried building and I get: "_Specified SDKMACHINE value is not valid_"

pi@raspberrypi ~/p/build> bitbake core-image-minimal
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/html5lib/_trie/_base.py:3: 
DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' 
instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop 
working
   from collections import Mapping
WARNING: Host distribution "raspbian-10" has not been validated with 
this version of the build system; you may possibly experience unexpected 
failures. It is recommended that you use a tested distribution.
ERROR:  OE-core's config sanity checker detected a potential 
misconfiguration.
     Either fix the cause of this error or at your own risk disable the 
checker (see sanity.conf).
     Following is the list of potential problems / advisories:

     Specified SDKMACHINE value is not valid

Summary: There was 1 WARNING message shown.
Summary: There was 1 ERROR message shown, returning a non-zero exit 
code.
I've tried setting SDKMACHINE to 'arm' and 'qemuarm' but get the same 
message?

Obviously I failed to do something (properly)?

Ideas?
