We are finalizing the agenda for the developer meeting this Friday (May 
20). The agenda has some topics carried from prior meetings and some new 
ideas we will cover at the bottom. We would like to get additional 
topics that matter to users and developers. Please review:

and add your ideas for topics we should discuss. Members of the 
OpenEmbedded board and Technical steering committee will be around on 
irc in #oe on libera.chat.

Philip

Hello Philip,

when would the time slots be allocated? It doesn't look optimal to
leave this to the last minute, as people need to plan their day.
