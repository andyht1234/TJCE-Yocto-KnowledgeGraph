Greetings,

I reused a simple "hello" recipe and added a non-matching checksum to it:

...
SRC_URI = "file://helloworld.c"
SRC_URI[md5sum] = "34f0efd76b4f18888888888833cdd129"
...

The rest of the recipe comes from
https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/tree/meta-skeleton/recipes-skeleton/hello-single.

Why doesn't Bitbake stop, reporting that the checksum doesn't match the
source file?
Anyway, why does the recipe build without a checksum? Shouldn't
checksums be mandatory?

I'm using the "master" version of Poky.

Thanks in advance
Michael.

Checksums are for files that are fetched via http:// and friends, not
local files.

No they are not mandatory for all fetchers. They are only used for 
content downloaded from non-local archives. 
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/bitbake/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual-fetching.html#the-download-fetch

^^ here you can see the selection of URI's that automatically needs a 
checksum.

Best regards,

Thanks for your replies. This all makes perfect sense then.
Thanks again
Michael.

Personally, I think where the checksums are present, we should check them
regardless of url type though. I think I have an open bug related to this and
the uninative fetching.

Cheers,

Richard
