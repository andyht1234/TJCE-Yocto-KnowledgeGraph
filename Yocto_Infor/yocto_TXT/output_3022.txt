It is not guaranteed to build or work otherwise, and causes
update failures in unrelated recipes when building for musl for instance.

Please report the problems to mailing list and we can try to help if 
they do not work with musl. We do support systemd/musl combination and 
try to keep it working
this will limit testing this combination.

This change is prompted by the recent period where musl patches wouldn't
even apply to systemd, which broke half of AUH upgrade attempts.

You need to enable systemd/musl on the autobuilder matrix first, if testing
the feature is a concern.

Interesting, outside AB we build extended world on musl and it works
well. systemd porters usually port the patches as needed for musl

yes, I think thats a fair point, I will bring this up.
