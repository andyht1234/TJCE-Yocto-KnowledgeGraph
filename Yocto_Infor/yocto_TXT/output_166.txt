Hi guys,
So long back I was trying to load driver files for a battery charger and a
battery fuel gauge as a kernel module. However I face errors that are
actually related to cross-compilation. I  am not sure how to proceed with
this. Can you guys refer to some documentation from both the yocto project
and any other that can help.
Thanks

Regards,
Hassan

As you did not provide any meaningful information (no errors, no source, no
logs), maybe you should start there if you expect people to help you.

For documentation, please see
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/kernel-dev/common.html#working-with-out-of-tree-modules

Greetz,
Josef
