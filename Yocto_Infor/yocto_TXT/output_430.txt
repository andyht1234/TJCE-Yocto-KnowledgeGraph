Hi

As you know Yocto Build is time consuming, we'd like to check with you to see if there is any way to have Yocto Build go with distcc as we have multiple build servers shared by the office members. If going with distcc, they can be effectively leveraged.
We did some try, but hit below error immediately. :(

Why not proxy state cache?

You can use the icecc which is very similar to distcc.
