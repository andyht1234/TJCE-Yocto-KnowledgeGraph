There is a bug in the chrony Kirkstone recipe that was fixed in Langdale but has not been fixed in Kirkstone:
https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-devel/message/99080?p=%2C%2C%2C20%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A%3Arecentpostdate%2Fsticky%2C%2Cchrony+pkg-config%2C20%2C2%2C0%2C94155994
This adds pkgconfig to the inherit line to allow configure to find pkg-config.  Without this fix the recipe cannot build some features like NTS.

How to get this fix into Kirkstone?  Do I submit a patch?

Yes please, it does cherry-pick back cleanly but I didn't take the time 
to build/test.
