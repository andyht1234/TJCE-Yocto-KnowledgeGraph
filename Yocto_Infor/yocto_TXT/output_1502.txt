Inside the do_install I copy some files
but it seems that bitbake set those files in the RDEPENS.

In the log during the do_root_fs I see:
Requires(post): ... mylib.so

After that the commands fail with the error message:

Problem: conflicting
requests
 - nothing provides mylib.so needed by mypackage-0.10.14r0.core2_64

Is there a way to disable this behaviour?

It's hard to say what happens if we can't see your recipes. Can you
publish them?
