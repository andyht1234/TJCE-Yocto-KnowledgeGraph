I am seeing that logical volumes in /etc/fstab are not present at boot time when mountall.sh is being run
on my image based off Poky/Honister, with lvm2 recipe

After boot, once I log in, lsblk shows the mount points and "mount -a" works as expected.Â  At boot, alas no dice.

Any suggestions on how to get the logical volumes in place so that they can be mounted from /etc/fstab during boot when mountall.sh is being run?

*During boot:*
At Beginning of mountall.sh
NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda 8:0 0 55.9G 0 disk
|-sda1 8:1 0 101.9M 0 part
`-sda2 8:2 0 55.8G 0 part

After mounting file systems

*Post Boot:*
root@intel-corei7-64:/tmp# lsblk
NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda 8:0 0 55.9G 0 disk
|-sda1 8:1 0 101.9M 0 part
`-sda2 8:2 0 55.8G 0 part
|-mount-pt-a 252:0 0 1000M 0 lvm
|-mount-pt-b 252:1 0 100M 0 lvm
|-mount-pt-c 252:2 0 6.3G 0 lvm

Thanks,

Bruce
