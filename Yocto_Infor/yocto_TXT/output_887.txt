Dear community,

I am using yocto for my embedded image for a compute module 4. A camera sensor is connected to the CM4 and the camera module is loaded correctly as I can use v4l2-ctl to write frames.

However, libcamera is not able to find the camera when I use the "cam -l" app.
I include libcamera using:

IMAGE_INSTALL += "libcamera"

Am I missing something? I haven't been able to find any documentation on libcamera in yocto.

Kind regards

This might help.
