It's hard to say anything without seeing the recipe and the patches.
Can you publish them somewhere?

When I do “devtool finish <recipe> <location>” it will delete old patches and add only my patch. It is same if I use “devtool update-recipe <recipe>”. Has anyone ever had similar problem?

I think that I am not allowed to publish the code, but I can try to explain what I have done.
1. There were in total 8 patches before I started to work
2. Run: devtool modify linux-ttc
3. I applied changes to one header file (added 2 lines at the end of the file) and run git add . and git commit -m “some message”
4. Run devtool finish linux-ttc ../repo/meta-fusion-bsp
5. Command passes and it added my new patch file and updated .bb file, but old patches are deleted and removed from .bb file

Same behaviour is when I used devtool update-recipe linux-ttc

Best regards,
Vanja
