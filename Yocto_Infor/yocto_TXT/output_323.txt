I'm a Yocto noob so apologies if this is an obvious question.

I was just checking our usage of OpenSSH because of
https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-38408/ and it appears:
1. We're using a vulnerable version (9.3p1 on main, 8.9p1 on Kirkstone/LTS)
2. The ForwardAgent feature is enabled by default
(https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/tree/meta/recipes-connectivity/openssh/openssh/ssh_config)

There doesn't seem to be a bug for this yet
(https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=openssh).

So what's the process? Is this already being worked on somewhere or
should I upgrade the version? If the latter should I do this on
Kirkstone (which is what we're using) then main?

Thanks.,

Usually, the version should be upgraded in master and only the fix
backported in kirkstone.

Thanks,
