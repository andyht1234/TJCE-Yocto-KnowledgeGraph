Hi,
Has anyone tried to build yocto 2.6 on Ubuntu 20.04?
I know it's not supported, but it's a major task for me to upgrade to yocto
3.x.
I tried it myself and it fails on building qemu-native.
I wonder if anyone worked around this.

Thanks,
Jacob

I think the best way out for you is to set up a container with a supported
older distribution. Usually you need an older gcc version from the host
machine, so the container will have that.

It's been a while, but I was able to build yocto sumo (2.5) using
