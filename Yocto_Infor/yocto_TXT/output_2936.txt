Hi,

Please don't use screen shots, but pastebin instead. I already mentioned 
this on fb.

My comments are inline.

It misses ldd.

It's here:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/recipes-core/glibc/glibc-package.inc

You might want to try something like:

IMAGE_INSTALL += "ldd"

Regards,

Robert
