Hello,

i am trying to install the PostgreSQL and the development package (postgresql-server-dev) as part of the SDK.

I added via bbappend BBCLASSEXTED_append = "nativesdk" to the postgresql_12.9.bb.

I can build an image for a raspberry 4 pi.
However when i try to populate the sdk it stops with an error during the do_install() for PostgreSQL:

| chown: invalid user: ‘postgres:postgres’
| WARNING: exit code 1 from a shell command.

This happens when the owner for pgsql libs is changed to the user postgres.
I did create a the user manually on the host system but this didn't help with the problem.

If i build the image itself it works flawlessly.

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

Best Regards

Alexander

I suspect this was solved with

I integrated the changes of the commit you posted, however i still have the same error message coming up. Do i need to make changes in the recipe to make the  intercept work?

No, it should have changed PATH in the recipe and used these intercept
scripts. The intercept scripts should have changed the user/group to
"root", which would work under pseudo in the SDK context.

You'll probably have to debug it a little bit, I'd check to see if the
intercept scripts are being called, if so, then check the
substitutions. If not, work out what PATH looks like and why they're
not being called.

That patch is how we fixed the issue on master though so it should be
close, I'm surprised it doesn't work.

Cheers,

Richard
