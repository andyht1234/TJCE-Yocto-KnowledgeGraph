Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.4 M3 is built and now in QA. This means we are now feature
complete for 3.4 and will be working on stabilization.
*	YP 3.3.3 has been built and is waiting in the queue for QA after 3.4
M3. This includes the override syntax compatibility changes.
*	SBOM generation work was merged in and will be in the release as
preliminary work on this topic, there will likely be some further tweaks
during M4.
*	Further rust issues were resolved such as the centos7 build issues.
*	A work around for the glibc 2.34 clone3 syscalls in uninative was
added and a new uninative built/released.
*	A fix for some of the multiconfig issues where deadlocked tasks and
tasks were showing errors being on both the "covered and not covered lists"
is available in master-next for review, hopefully addressing the issues that
were being reported. This was possible from a better test case that was
submitted enabling debugging.
*	Intermittent issues are ongoing and help is very much welcome on
these issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to see by
searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
