Greetings everyone,

Is there a way to instruct Yocto's image class to install package(s) without its dependencies for an image target (i.e ext4)? For instance, we are trying to build a system where there is a main system partition and another partition that'll host additional lib, etc and during boot up we would overlay them together. Hence, the "other" partition does not really need all the same system libs, etc that already exists on the system partition. This other partition is developed by an external partner so we want to have the autonomy to update separately (i.e not mingled things together with system partition). I am having trouble finding a way to do this because Yocto seem to like to install a package long with all its dependencies (i.e glibc, etc).

PS. I apologize if this is not the right place to ask the question.

Thanks,
Mike

Yes.

This is a version of the question - "how do I build an image that *ONLY*
includes the packages I explicitly specify". This involves bypassing a lot
of guards and bitbake tooling, but it can be done.

Your mileage may vary depending on your distro setup. In particular this
assumes you are configured to use the IPK package format. The dnf command
had significant issues a while back, so I switched from RPM to IPK. If you
use RPM, the OPKG_ARGS stuff not going to work for you.

IMAGE_FEATURES = ""
LDCONFIGDEPEND = ""
IMAGE_INSTALL = ""
PACAKGE_INSTALL = ""
OPKG_ARGS += "--no-install-recommends --nodeps --force-depends"

ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND_remove = "systemd_create_users; "
ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND_remove = "rootfs_update_timestamp; "
ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND_remove = "rootfs_reproducible; "

IMAGE_CMD_cpio_prepend() {
    IMAGE_BUILDING_DEBUGFS="true"
}

If you want the pre and postinstall scripts to trigger, you need to add an
IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND function that takes your PACKAGE_INSTALL list and
concatenates the package level control, preinst, and postinst scripts. This
involves unpacking the ipk found in
${WORKDIR}/oe-rootfs-repo/*/${PKG}_*.ipk. You may also want to post-process
the resulting script to remove "set -e" invocations, since those scripts
make assumptions about dependencies that you are (hopefully) safe to ignore.

You may also want another IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND function that deletes
stuff that can accidentally overwrite your image rootfs files, like
/etc/passwd and /etc/group.

Once you get it all dialed in, you can probably abstract the useful bits to
your own image-layer bbclass so you can trivially reuse it.

..Ch:W..
