When the log name contains a space, the generated URL is not correct. This
later also breaks parsing in swatbot. This was triggered by "property
changes" and the correct URL is indeed logs/property_changes.

This is untested because I don't have the setup handy but, I hope, it is
trivial enough to work properly
