Hi all,


I've googled most of the day, but to no avail. How does one compile and 
add to the image the daemon usbipd? Is there a bitbake file already for 
this? The code is part of the kernel found in the kernel tree:

KERNEL_SRC_PATH/tools/usb/usbip/src

and is invoked from the KERNEL_SRC_PATH/tools directory by calling

make usb


from: 
https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/How_to_build_Linux_kernel_user_space_tools

PC $> cd <Linux_kernel_source_path>/tools
PC $> make <tool>


I would think that there is a preexisting recipe.

thanks,

Chuck

There isn't one that I've ever heard of, and the layerindex
(http://layers.openembedded.org/) confirms that nothing registered
with it provides that recipe.

So if you need it, you'd have to create a recipe .. and submit it to
somewhere like meta-openembedded if appropriate.

Have a look at the perf recipe for one of the ways we build tools out
of the kernel source. Something similar will work in this case.

Thanks for the quick reply. I looked at the perf recipe, and its quite 
involved. Is there a simpler recipie to use as a template? Perhaps one 
of these?

meta-openembedded/meta-oe/recipes-kernel/bpftool/bpftool.bb

meta-openembedded/meta-oe/recipes-kernel/spidev-test/spidev-test.bb

meta-openembedded/meta-oe/recipes-kernel/cpupower/cpupower.bb


all three of these appear to be basically the same very simple bb file.


Chuck

My intent was just to show how you'd get the source from whatever
kernel you are building,

Assuming that you don't need to patch the sources directly, any of
those would likely work ... depending on the dependencies and options
of what tool you are building.
