Hi,

I'm wondering how to resolve the following error:

ERROR: sample-image-cp-lwb5plus-1.0-r0 do_rootfs: Postinstall scriptlets 
of ['lrd-networkmanager-sterling'] have failed. If the intention is to 
defer them to first boot,
then please place them into pkg_postinst_ontarget_${PN} ().
Deferring to first boot via 'exit 1' is no longer supported.
Details of the failure are in 
/home/yocto/rzv_vlp_v3.0.0/build/tmp/work/smarc_rzv2l-poky-linux/sample-image-cp-lwb5plus/1.0-r0/temp/log.do_rootfs.
ERROR: Logfile of failure stored in:

failed with exit code '1'

the log file 
~/rzv_vlp_v3.0.0/build/tmp/work/smarc_rzv2l-poky-linux/sample-image-cp-lwb5plus/1.0-r0/temp/log.do_rootfs.430788 
contains the following on the bottom:

...
 Â  wayland-1.18.0-r0.aarch64

Complete!

and the same does 
/home/yocto/rzv_vlp_v3.0.0/build/tmp/work/smarc_rzv2l-poky-linux/sample-image-cp-lwb5plus/1.0-r0/temp/log.do_rootfs

Not very helpful, is it? How can I resolve this?

You need to show the whole log.
