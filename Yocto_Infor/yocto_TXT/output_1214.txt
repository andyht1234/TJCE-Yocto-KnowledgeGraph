Hello,

I try to use yocto SSTATE_MIRROR with a custom distribution (RDK: https://developer.rdkcentral.com/) and enabled yocto multilib support.
The sstate directory is created by my build server and published with nginx to the developer machines.

Environment:
Bitbake 1.46.0 / Yocto Dunfell 3.1

TUNE_PKGARCH = “cortexa53t2hf-neon-fp-armv8”

MULTILIBS = "multilib:lib32"

TARGET_VENDOR="-rdk"

TARGET_OS="linux"

When a developer configures the sstate mirror in his local.conf:

SSTATE_MIRRORS ?= " file://.* http://<build server>/sstate-cache/PATH;downloadfilename=PATH "

the build gets stuck on various _setscene tasks and does not continue. I did some debugging and the issue is related the with file name length of the sstate files. When the developer machine tries to download a file from the mirror, bitbake fetch wants to create a local lock file with name " <file name>.lock". Example of a sstate lock file that fails for me:

sstate:lib32-dibbler:cortexa53t2hf-neon-fp-armv8-rdkmllib32-linux-gnueabi:1.0.1+1.0.2RC1+gitc4b0ed52e751da7823dd9a36e91f93a6310e5525:r0:cortexa53t2hf-neon-fp-armv8:3:169be56e277b6922d1cca3f23f6d56033812941a438f09a477cd96999d7d0801_package_qa.tgz.siginfo.lock

This lock file cannot be created on a ext file system due the file name length > 255. This causes the _setscene task to get stuck indefinitely. It seems like most Linux file systems only support file names up to 255 bytes.

Is there a way to configure or limit the file name length of the sstate cache files? Or a way to avoid the issue with the .lock file?

Thanks

Markus

There were changes in bitbake:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/bitbake/lib/bb/utils.py?id=273b124bf6acd77b074fde2421be331721a68c11

There were also sstate class changes:

I'll cherry-pick those changes and test on autobuilder.

Thanks, I applied the patches locally and it fixed the issue for me.
