Hi all,
I have updated BUILDHISTORY_FEATURES=image to avoid including the package directory in the build history. However, I am still seeing the package directory with numerous subdirectories in the build history.
How can I completely exclude the package directory from the build history?
The following is what I see in the buildhistory directory.
~/ws/OpenBMC/build/dc-scm-m1110$ ls buildhistory
images  metadata-revs  packages

I assume this directory buildhistory/ was created fresh after above change
