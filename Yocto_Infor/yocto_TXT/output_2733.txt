Hi Guys,

I am facing compile-time issue (extra-cmake-modules-native-5.81.0 ). Using bitbake extra-cmake-modules it's compiled fine. It is dependent on other packages. Using bitbake extra-cmake-modules is compiled success. other dependent package expecting extra-cmake-modules-native.

build/tmp-glibc/work/x86_64-linux/extra-cmake-modules-native/5.81.0-r0/temp/run.do_compile.21147' failed with exit code 1:
build/tmp-glibc/work/x86_64-linux/extra-cmake-modules-native/5.81.0-r0/build/docs/html > build-html.log
*FAILED: docs/doc_format_html*
*Could not import extension ecm (exception: cannot import name 'htmlescape')

* How can I fix this issue or build time it is going to docs so how I can disable it.Â  or any patch available gives some suggestions to fix this issue.

Thanks & Regards,
Sateesh
