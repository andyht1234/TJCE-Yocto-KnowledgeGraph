In Hardknott, trying to enabled signed uboot containers for signed fitimage
The interaction between the uboot-sign.bbclass and the imx-boot.bb is not working

MACHINE=imx8qxq-mek
UBOOT_SIGN_ENABLE= "1"
FIT_SIGN_INDIVIDUAL="1"

(no SPL_SIGN_ENABLE)

I see the updated u-boot.bin in the uboot ${B}{config} sub-directory but other copies are still the original u-boot.bin

  *   The updated u-boot.bin = u-boot-nodtb.bin + u-boot-pubkey.dtb ,
When imx-boot creates the flash.bin, it is using original u-boot.bin , not the updated one.

Have confirmed if I put the updated u-boot.bin where imx-boot will use when creating the flash.bin , then the resulting uboot will only boot signed fitImages .

Any known work-arounds ? or this a known bug?
Thanks
Richard Allen
