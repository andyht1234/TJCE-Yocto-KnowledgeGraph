The following code is an effective workaround. It must be added after the
core-image is inherited.

python () {
     pseudo_ignore_paths = d.getVar('PSEUDO_IGNORE_PATHS')
     result = ','.join([x for x in pseudo_ignore_paths.split(',') if
"intercept_scripts" not in x])
     d.setVar('PSEUDO_IGNORE_PATHS', result)
}

..Ch:W..

This should be fixed in master, the issue was triggered by a checkout 
owned by root/root:

http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=eff192abe2ee43ebf981bafbb7fca8602ebdcf0c

Steve/Anuj: We'll likely want to backport that one.

Cheers,

Richard
