* [yocto][meta-python2] Kirkstone EXTRANATIVEPATH is not in effect

I have a bb file abc_1.0.bb:
DEPENDS += "python3-native"
And EXTRANATIVEPATH contains "python3-native" as expected, so command 'python3'
can be searched.

Then I add DEPENDS += "python-native", but EXTRANATIVEPATH doesn't contains
"python-native", so command 'python' can not be searched.

python3native.bbclass  has a line:
EXTRANATIVEPATH += "python3-native"
So python3 can be searched when bitbake this recipe. I saw similar codes in the
pythonnative.bbclass file, but why didn't it take effect?

Did you add "inherit pythonnative" or DEPENDS += "python-native"?

You need just the inherit line.

I added:
DEPENDS += "python-native python-setuptools-native".

I think it should work just fine, because:
python-setuptools.bb    inherit setuptools      -->
setuptools.bbclass      inherit distutils       -->
distutils.bbclass       inherit distutils-base  -->
distutils-base.bbclass  inherit pythonnative    -->
pythonnative.bbclass   contains 'EXTRANATIVEPATH += "python-native"'

I don't know why my EXTRANATIVEPATH doesn't contain python-native when I run
'bitbake -e <my_package_name>'. And this causes my bitbake can not search
'python2'.

Because you didn't inherit pythonnative?

Yes. Everything works fine after I inherit pythonnative. I mistakenly
thought that there was no need to inhert it manually.
