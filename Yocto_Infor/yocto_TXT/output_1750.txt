Since ~16 months the base of meta-rust was merged into meta-oe,
down to honister as far as I can see, and therefore the indications
to use meta-rust are really not needed and may just create extra
work and possibly problems to users.

thanks for the patch.

did I miss some rust changes in 
https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-security/commit/?h=master-next&id=edf8b109e77f6d3f2740e09bdc89f0aaf2885dc4

Hi Armin,
Sorry if it was unclear or if I misunderstood something.

As far as I could see and tried as I had to build it yesterday, I can now
build suricata without adding meta-rust as the rust support (compilers etc)
is now already in oe-core, ie:
https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/tree/meta/recipes-devtools/rust
and
https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/tree/meta/recipes-devtools/cargo
Some relevant discussion: https://github.com/meta-rust/meta-rust/pull/364

The note in README may still just apply to versions < honister I believe
(ie. dunfell is the only not EOL-ed). For more recent versions it may just
potentially create confusion IMO.

Cheers,
Federico
