Hi team,

With respect to the feature "CVE_CHECK" provided by Yocto, what is the best approach to deploy the patches reported by the CVE?

It's definitely not a good approach to patch using a blind approach but once we've defined the required CVE, does Yocto can do the updates based on a definition?

I've read the content of the cve-check.bbclass without founding the appropriate way to do it.

If I forgot to read a section in the Mega-Manual per example, please let me know and I will read it.

Thank you,
