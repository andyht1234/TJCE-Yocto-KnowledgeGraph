Hi,
I have a imx6ul board that I am working on (SOM has been purchased from a company).
We are using Krogoth (2.1) and we need to have ntpd as a part of the build. ntpd is working ok, however the tzdata that we have in /usr/share/zoneinfo is missing a lot of zones (looking at it in detail we realized that 30 min timezones are missing .. i.e. GMT+4:30 , +5:30 etc.). One hour timezones are available. i,e, GMT-3 ... etc Any suggestion on where to look for or what should be the approach to fix this ?

Wow, Krogoth is 7 years old! Are you sure you want to develop a product 
with such an obsolete version? Your root filesystem will be full of 
unpatched vulnerabilities.
If you are sure you want to continue this way, you should try to update 
the tzdata recipe to a more recent version (see the updates to the 
recipe in the Poky git repository).

Cheers
Michael.

Thanks Michael for your response
I know we are using an old version. It is what the SOM manufacturer
supports so we are going with it to start with and we will change once we
get a grip on the SOM. Till then we have to work with what we have. We
tried updating the recipe and got it to compile and found that ln -sf .....
did not work (did not change the timezone).
So back to square one. So from your message I understand we are on the
right track , just need to keep debugging
And yes we will change to the latest Yocto build soon.
Thanks once again
