Hello,

I'm trying to integrate mender for tinker-board-s using meta-rockchip
dunfell branch. When added meta-mender which add few patches to
u-boot I'm seeing u-boot compilation issues like:

Error: SPL image is too large (size 0x11000 than 0x8000)
| Error: Bad parameters for image type

Error is clear to me but patches which mender adds are related mostly
to the environment so I'm not sure how SPL can increase size. Any
ideas on how to resolve this issue?

Thanks and regards,

marek

I'm adding dunfell support for mender :). In this link mender rockchip
integration is for older u-boot not 2020.01

Did some sort of "enable environment support in SPL" option get enabled
in your patches perhaps?
