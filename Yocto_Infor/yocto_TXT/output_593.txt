Hello there!

Time is running out for you if you'd like to speak at the Yocto Project

EOSS.

You have exactly...*checks clock* 3 hours and 44 minutes left to let us
know about the cool things you built, the riddles you solved, or just how
you use or support the Yocto Project.

So hurry up!

Greetz,
Josef of on behalf of the organization team

PS: 3 hours and 42 minutes now, sorry.
