I installed the eltt2(https://github.com/Infineon/eltt2) into my system and it requires theÂ linux-vdso.so.1.
So I add the two lines into my liunx-yocto_%.bbappend, but the vdso64.so didn't install into the rootfs.
KERNEL_FEATURES += "features/vdso/vdso.scc"
IMAGE_INSTALL += "vdso"

I also add do_install to add vdso64.so
do_install:append () {
install -d ${D}${libdir}/modules/${KERNEL_VERSION}/vdso
install -m 644 -g root -o root ${B}/arch/x86/entry/vdso/vdso64.so ${D}${libdir}/modules/${KERNEL_VERSION}/vdso/
}
I got the installed in the package folder
package/usr/lib/modules/6.1.25-yocto-standard/vdso/vdso64.so
However, it didn't work. is there any idea? or suggestion
