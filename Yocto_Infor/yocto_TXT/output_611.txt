Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.1.4 has been released.
*	YP 3.1.25 has been released.
*	YP 4.0.10 is in QA

*	Richard is taking this week off, Ross is covering in his absence.
*	M1 is approaching fast, so please try and get any major changes
submitted soon.
*	The Edgerouter (MIPS64-based) has been removed from the reference
hardware due to lack of support. Testing for MIPS64 platforms will continue
using qemumips64. There will be further changes to the reference hardware
platforms, specifically around 64-bit Arm testing.

*	Patches have been merging into master, thanks to everyone for both
review feedback and iterating on patches
*	There are time64 patches being proposed to handle Y2038 issues on 32
bit architectures which likely need further discussion since the compiler
flag changes aren't without risk and potential side effects.
*	We're aiming to improve documentation as we go along in this
release, please keep this in mind when sending patches. Adding to the
documentation as we go will make the release a lot easier.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components
which are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying
to keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex,
devtool, toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more.
Many have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
components!
*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
*	Help us resolve CVE issues:

*	We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.
