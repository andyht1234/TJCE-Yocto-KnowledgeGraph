Is it possible that this small patch missed your filters?

Cheers, Peter

Thanks for merging this patch, but I've just spotted it in langdale too, 
which is breaking one of our internal builds as the addpylib directive 
is incompatible with langdale's Bitbake. Please could you revert this 
patch in langdale and apply to mickledore instead.

Thanks,

Peter
