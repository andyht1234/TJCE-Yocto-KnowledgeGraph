Key Status/Updates:

*	We plan to build M2 this week once we have pzstd included in the
buildtools tarball
*	Once M2 is built, 3.3.2 will follow into QA.
*	There are proposals to add lz4c, zstd and pzstd as required host
commands which we hope will allow better data archiving for license
information and possibly for bitbake hash debugging too.
*	There are proposals and discussions on the architecture list around
improving the syntax for overrides in the metadata. This would be a major
change of a type we haven't make in a while. The proposal includes the
option of allowing the syntax in older bitbake versions to make metadata
compatibility easier. Please comment on those discussions on the list if you
have opinions on this.
*	The prserv rewrite is still pending on resolving the issues with
python asyncio.
*	Intermittent issues are ongoing, particularly ptest ones. Help is
very much welcome on these issues. You can see the list of failures we're
continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT
*	The multiconfig changes in bitbake continue to cause problems, we
still need simpler test cases to reproduce issues rather than huge builds.
The existing patches seem to fix some workloads and break others and current
test cases are very slow to work with.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
