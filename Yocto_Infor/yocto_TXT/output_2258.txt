Hi,

I plan to use readonly rootfs option and store some custom data in separate
partition (like hostname, wpa_supplicant.conf etc). I have wic file which
create rootfs + then rest is for data storage. I can adjust various recipes
to symlink to /data partition. My question is if there exists some
mechanism how to store some pieces in non-rootfs partition? I know some
projects which put those extra files to deploy dir and then by dd create
dummy storage nd put files there and finally create partition from that.
Thanks a log for any pointers.

BR,

marek

You could potentially use overlayfs to have a RO rootfs and a separate RW
layer in another partition for example. I think linux-yocto also support
AUFS.

Good luck,

Marc

We do this a lot using volatiles files. The best documentation is the
core volatiles file:

This one seems promising:
https://github.com/cmhe/meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay
This is not exactly what I was looking for but I think it can be usable.
Anyone using this? Thanks.

Can this be used when systemd is init manager? Thanks.

I'm pretty sure systemd processes volatiles as well, although I can't
find the exact code to point to at the moment to confirm it.

Hi:

I was wondering if anybody is using meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay?

Thanks

Hello Howard,

i use parts of it (without a writeable partition, just a tmpfs) in a separate layer: https://github.com/matthiasklein/meta-distro-coffee/blob/master/recipes-core/readonly-rootfs-overlay/readonly-rootfs-overlay_1.0.bb
Best regards,
Matthias

rootfs-overlay ( https://github.com/cmhe/meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay ) is the perfect solution for your case.

Hi

Not long ago we use it in couple of projects. Main repo can be found
here, https://github.com/cmhe/meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay

You can also find our fork with couple of changes (on of them is for example
adjustions for honister release.
