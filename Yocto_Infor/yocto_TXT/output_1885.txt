There was one failure in this build on a new performance worker. We've just
switched over to the new performance workers so we can decommission the others
and apply the data centre power budget to other things. I don't think that
should block release.

I'll work with Steve to get the changes we need sorted so this doesn't happen in
future, the issues are to do with the html email report generation which we no
longer use.

Cheers,

Richard

Thanks!

The TSC did discuss the perf issue earlier in the week and were good to release
if there were no other issues found, we should therefore be good to release.

Cheers,
