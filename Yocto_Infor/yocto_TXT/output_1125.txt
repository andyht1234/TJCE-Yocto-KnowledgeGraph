Hi Yocto community,

I run into an issue where I can't use the runqemu command by use of the SDK. It reports the following:
    "runqemu - ERROR - Failed to run qemu: qemu-system-arm: -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,hostfwd=tcp::2323-:23,tftp=<path>: Parameter 'type' expects a netdev backend type"
I start qemu with: "runqemu qemuarm nographic slirp <some-name>qemuarm.qemuboot.conf", it works correctly when running with the native tools from the Yocto env.
The difference between the Yocto env and the SDK is that the netdev reports 'user' to be present within the Yocto env but is missing in the SDK.

I've already asked around on IRC and "rburton" suggested to look into commit "2d96d3f5ace29bb886d825609bd042310019a620", that commit has already been backported to the Yocto kirkstone branch
and is included in my build. I've cleaned qemu (cleanall) from my system but I still face this issue.

Does anyone have any suggestions in how to solve this?

Thank you.

Hi Yocto community,

I figured out what happened, hopefully this is useful to anyone.

We did use parts from the meta-cloud-service repository, to be specific the meta-openstack. That layer has a qemu_6.%.bbappend file which assigns the qemu packageconfig.
(that append file only includes the qemu inc file if the openstack is enabled in the distro features).
The Yocto qemu recipe only has a soft assignment to the packageconfig so the one from the meta-openstack layer is getting used which did not include slirp and other options.
So I removed the openstack from the distro features and behold, it works as expected.

I don't know if this is a bug or just a feature, but I leave that up to you (perhaps Yocto can assign the packageconfig a bit stronger?).
