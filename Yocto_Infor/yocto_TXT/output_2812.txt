Hello all,

I built an image based on core-image and added the package gtk+3-demos. I'm using wayland with weston compositor. Unfortunately icons seem to be missing. Can anyone give me a hint on what went wrong? I'm on Dunfell.

Here's a screenshot: https://imgur.com/syLzQ1l

Thanks a lot!
Manuel

The icons are typically provided by adwaita-icon-theme, so you need to
check whether that package is installed, and then whether it's missing
something. strace may help so you see what files are the demos trying to
open.

I had the same idea right around the time you replied. It worked!

Strace is good advice, am using strace now to track down that one missing icon. (See my subthread.)

Thanks for helping! Manuel
