Hello Naveen,
At least one team within Arm is planning on doing a product using meta-zephyr and basing it off of langdale, and would like a Langdale branch on meta-zephyr for continuity with the other branches.

With the recent release of Langdale for Yocto, I was wondering if there are any plans to fork a branch for Langdale on meta-zephyr.  Doing so prior to updating the zephyr sources to the latest might be a good idea.

Thanks,
Jon

Hi Jon,

I have forked Langdale branch.

Could you help to fix arm machines failures with zephyr 3.2.0 upgrade patches ?

Hi Naveen,
I'll take a look at it, and hopefully have a solution tomorrow.

Thanks,
