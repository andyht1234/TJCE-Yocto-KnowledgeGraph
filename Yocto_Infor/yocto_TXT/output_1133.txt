Hey all,

I've done some digging with this myself, but have not found a root
cause, fix, or workaround. Google shows me that a number of other
users have encountered this problem as well with Yocto, but I have not
found a solution with those either.

Native targets are stuck in the do_install phase and can literally
hang for days.

Currently  2 running tasks (2004 of 2078)  96%
...
0: nativesdk-dtc-1.6.0-r0 do_install - 1h17m52s (pid 2572369)
1: nativesdk-kmod-27-r0 do_install - 1h16m2s (pid 2656202)

Does anyone have any debugging suggestions?

$ strace -p 2572369
strace: Process 2572369 attached
pselect6(15, [12 14], [], [], {tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=526887424}, NULL) = 0 (Timeout)
wait4(2572898, 0x7ffd153a439c, WNOHANG, NULL) = 0
pselect6(15, [12 14], [], [], {tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=526887424}, NULL) = 0 (Timeout)
wait4(2572898, 0x7ffd153a439c, WNOHANG, NULL) = 0
pselect6(15, [12 14], [], [], {tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=526887424}, NULL) = 0 (Timeout)
wait4(2572898, 0x7ffd153a439c, WNOHANG, NULL) = 0
...

$ ps -fw 2572368
... /bin/sh ... temp/run.do_install.2572369

I can send a signal to the parent process (e.g. kill -USR1 2572368)
but then the process fails. I can do a clean on the targets, but the
exact same problem repeats itself.

Manually stepping through build phases also does not work, as
do_install simply hangs again when I get there.

It seems to be a pretty serious problem and not an isolated issue.
Complete showstopper, as the Yocto build cannot proceed beyond this
point without manual hacks.

I've encountered this while building the Zephyr SDK [1] on a company
machine (where it actually matters) but am unable to reproduce the
issue inside of a
centos-stream-9 docker container [2] (where it doesn't matter).

I've tried rebooting, completely wiping all of the build directories,
standing on one foot, trying to forget about it, sleeping on it, etc.
Nothing seems to fix the issue.

So yea, the fun continues!

Any ideas?

In all cases, the problem is traced back to a Makefile, where
something calls $(shell git ... ) to get a git version.

I was able to find out because one shell had executed a script called
scripts/setlocalversion that looked kind of suspicious in terms of
error propagation. In this script, if I manually echoed "1.6.0" and
then exited, do_install would not hang.

Some early discussion suggests that it might be avoidable with 'set -o
pipefail' in the shell, but I haven't investigated further.

I don't have anything super helpful to add, but when that git command
is hung, are you seeing any stalled network connections or processes
in D state ?

It wasn't clear from your first message. Are all native processes hanging
at do_install ? or is it a subset ?

Is it maybe the restricted network access thats biting you?

The hung commands are in the S state (sleeping).

The build gets hung on bitbake hosttools-tarball and it seems to be
all of the native targets

Currently  4 running tasks (1519 of 2078)  73%
0: nativesdk-kmod-27-r0 do_install - 5s (pid 3450165)
1: nativesdk-xilinx-qemu-git-r0 do_install - 5s (pid 3450167)
2: nativesdk-zephyr-qemu-git-r0 do_install - 5s (pid 3450169)
3: nativesdk-arc-qemu-git-r0 do_install - 5s (pid 3450172)

If I pass in -vvv -DDD to bitbake I get this output

+ make -j 32 DESTDIR=/home/cfriedt/build-zephyr-sdk/sdk-ng/poky/build-zephyr-tools/tmp/work/x86_64-nativesdk-pokysdk-linux/nativesdk-kmod/27-r0/image
install
...
+ make -j 32 DESTDIR=/home/cfriedt/build-zephyr-sdk/sdk-ng/poky/build-zephyr-tools/tmp/work/x86_64-nativesdk-pokysdk-linux/nativesdk-xilinx-qemu/git-r0/image
install
...
+ make -j 32 DESTDIR=/home/cfriedt/build-zephyr-sdk/sdk-ng/poky/build-zephyr-tools/tmp/work/x86_64-nativesdk-pokysdk-linux/nativesdk-zephyr-qemu/git-r0/image

install

The exact commands that are hanging are
kmod: /bin/bash -c git describe  2>/dev/null
nativesdk-xilinx-qemu: /bin/bash -c git describe  2>/dev/null

In the kmod case, if I go to the build directory and do what the
Makefile does, it's obvious that git will fail since there is no .git
subdirectory.

$ git describe
fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything.

If I swap out the Makefile for something utterly trivial like this, it
still hangs

.PHONY: all install bar

foo-%:
        touch $@

bar: foo-$(shell git describe 2>/dev/null)

all: bar

install: bar

Is it specifically make processes that are hanging?

Not specifically, make has worked without issue.

Specifically, it seems to be restricted to do_install, on these nativesdk
recipes, when calling git in a subshell or script from make.

Aha!

Some internal tooling has "optimized" git... but apparently needs
further "optimization". So it looks as though this is a "user error".
