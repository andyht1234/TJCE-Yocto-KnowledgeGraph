Hi

Since the last version of bibake it looks like SRCREV must be set with a
SHA1 in order to fetch source from a git repository. We previously set it
with a tag corresponding to PV.
Manually retrieving the sha1 of the commit of a tag can easily lead to
mistakes.

Is there a way to ensure that the SRCREV is consistent with  PV?

Regards

Philippe

In webOS we use do_unpack postinst which checks that the SRCREV matches
with the expected tag name and that the tag is annotated, see
https://github.com/webosose/meta-webosose/blob/master/meta-webos/classes/webos_enhanced_submissions.bbclass#L117

Then for our own components (mostly using CMake) we also pass the version
from the recipe into CMake:
https://github.com/webosose/meta-webosose/blob/master/meta-webos/classes/webos_cmake.bbclass#L30
which is then compared with the version inside the component source during
the build:
https://github.com/webosose/cmake-modules-webos/blob/c3a5d821d1723c89936eaca82dc6d15605ad45ee/webOS/webOS.cmake#L530
so you cannot claim different version even if you tag matches it.

It's a bit more complicated, because we use WEBOS_VERSION variable which is
then split into PV (VERSION + SUBMISSION) and SRCREV,
but with enforced consistency across all our components this worked quite
well.

Cheers,

Hello

Thanks for your answer.

Reading your code, I wonder why you need to do a fetch, it looks very
resource consuming.

Hello,

the fetch is still executed in do_fetch task (and uses MIRROR/PREMIRROR
etc), maybe you mean the 2nd fetch when the tag doesn't exist in specified
branch added here:
https://github.com/openwebos/meta-webos/commit/bb59814990619065be5dcdbdeaa469e8fb2b8213
and that's executed only when needed (in case the tag WEBOS_VERSION points
to was pushed to repo, before the branch was created - at least that was
the case almost 10 years ago, there is longer history in old
openwebos/meta-webos repo:
https://github.com/openwebos/meta-webos/commits/master/classes/webos_enhanced_submissions.bbclass

Cheers,
