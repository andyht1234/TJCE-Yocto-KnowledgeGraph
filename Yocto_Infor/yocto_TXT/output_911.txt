Hi All

I need to generate the Unit Test cases for the code written for the Yocto
Recipes. How can I run the same in the Ubuntu machine? As cross compiled
binaries will not get executed at the Ubuntu.

Thanks
Chetan

You need to build the code outside of yocto using the toolchain
provided by ubuntu.

If built with yocto, your options are to run the tests under qemu
usermode, or in full qemu system emulation.
