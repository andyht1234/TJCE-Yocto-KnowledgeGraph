I was just looking up the Yocto LTS and I found
https://endoflife.date/yocto. It says:
3.1 'Dunfell' (LTS) Ends in 10 months (01 Apr 2024)
4.0 'Kirkstone' (LTS) Ends in 11 months (27 Apr 2024)

Are these dates correct? If so, what's the point of the later LTS
going EOL the same month as the previous one? There's not much point
in upgrading.

Is a new LTS planned?

Thanks.

Tom Isaacson

these dates are correct. Current LTS releases are for a period of 2
years, dunfell was extended
for another 2 years and became 4 years extended LTS, Kirkstone might
be extended for another 2 years too if the membership
decides to do so.

the next LTS is coming in April 2024. The duration for new LTS will be
2 years or 4 perhaps
but this will be decided by membership hopefully soon.

The next LTS is being released the same month that the current LTSs go
EOL? That seems a bit last minute. Or will the decision to extend
Kirkstone be made earlier?

FWIW, eol.date is - ironically - out of date.

wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases is the canonical release timetable.

Regardless of the current situation with EOL dates, the point of
upgrading is not that, but one's ability to fulfil current and future
business requirements and keep products secure. This is always easier
with a more recent stack for the target and tooling on the build host.

Thanks for pointing this, I've filed a PR to fix this [here](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/pull/3044).

A preview is available at https://deploy-preview-3044--endoflife-date.netlify.app/yocto. 
Would appreciate a review from folks on this list.

Planning to setup our automation against https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-docs/refs/ so we can notice new release much faster.

Thanks for this update! Note that

  * You're missing the recent 4.0.10 release
    (https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-docs/log/?h=kirkstone).
  * The 3.3 release was supported longer, until Apr. 20, 2022
    (https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-docs/log/?h=hardknott)

Shall I send a patch?

Good idea!
Thanks again
