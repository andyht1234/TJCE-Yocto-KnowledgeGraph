Hi All. i need to build mbpoll git://github.com/epsilonrt/mbpoll
I was created layer:

ivr@home-machine:~/work/yocto_orig/sources/meta-mbpoll/recipes-mbpoll/mbpoll
$ cat mbpoll_1.4.11.bb
SUMMARY = "bitbake-layers recipe"
DESCRIPTION = "mbpoll recipe"
LICENSE = "CLOSED"

SRC_URI = "git://github.com/epsilonrt/mbpoll"
SRCREV = "2b385d85d919138cefe79870c87c60eaa8b0d19c"

DEPENDS = "libmodbus"

i was run:
rm -rf ./build/tmp ./build/sstate-cache ./build/deploy
and
bitbake mbpoll

i am trying to search for a package

ivr@home-machine:~/work/yocto_orig/build
$ find . -name 'mbpoll*.ipk'
./tmp/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-phytec-linux-gnueabi/mbpoll/1.4.11-r0/deploy-ipks/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4/mbpoll-dev_1.4.11-r0_cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4.ipk
./tmp/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-phytec-linux-gnueabi/mbpoll/1.4.11-r0/deploy-ipks/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4/mbpoll-dbg_1.4.11-r0_cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4.ipk
./deploy/ipk/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4/mbpoll-dev_1.4.11-r0_cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4.ipk
./deploy/ipk/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4/mbpoll-dbg_1.4.11-r0_cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4.ipk

but i have only debug and dev packages, not simple mbpoll_version.ipk

i try to run:
bitbake -c clean mbpoll --force
and
bitbake mbpoll --force
but the task is done in a 1 second and

$ find . -name 'mbpoll*.ipk'
./tmp/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-phytec-linux-gnueabi/mbpoll/1.4.11-r0/deploy-ipks/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4/mbpoll-dev_1.4.11-r0_cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4.ipk
./tmp/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4-phytec-linux-gnueabi/mbpoll/1.4.11-r0/deploy-ipks/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4/mbpoll-dbg_1.4.11-r0_cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4.ipk
./deploy/ipk/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4/mbpoll-dev_1.4.11-r0_cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4.ipk
./deploy/ipk/cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4/mbpoll-dbg_1.4.11-r0_cortexa7t2hf-neon-vfpv4.ipk

found nothing

please tell me what am I doing wrong? Maybe I created the layer incorrectly?

if thats all of the recipe, then nothing will be built. you probably 
want to include at least the class for the buildsystem that you need, 
for example autotools, cmake, meson...

usually devtool is quite good at guessing that, so i'd suggest to start 
out with "devtool add"

again, any particular reason why you're poking the recipe by hand 
instead of just using devtool (which perfectly works in this case)? it 
would even give you a good start on the licenses, as well as not having 
missed the inherits.
