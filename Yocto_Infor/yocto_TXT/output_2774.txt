I am trying to create a first install package for our device, which would contain an install tool binary, and the required files to install.  In our case, that would be

From imx-usb_loader recipe:
imx_usb
imx_usb.conf
mx6_usb_rom.conf
mx6_usb_sdp_spl.conf

From u-boot recipe:
u-boot.img
SPL
uEnv.txt

The idea would be for the recipe to generate a tarball with all of that  and a script, that would automate the USB download project (the script: "install.sh" is already done, and is obviously out of scope for this question)

So I created a new recipe (box1-usb-loader.bb) which depends on both u-boot and imx-usb-loader.  But I can't seem to get the u-boot target files listed above to appear in my recipe-sysroot directory.

I've been scouring the web for a day now, and I've found plenty of people asking about seemingly related issues, but nothing that actually gets me nearer.  From what I could find, I'm missing something in my u-boot.bbappend to stage the three files I need, but everything I've tried has failed.  The most promising post got me to add this:


SYSROOT_DIRS += "${D}/boot"

do_stage () {
                install -d ${D}/boot
    install -m 0644 ${WORKDIR}/package/boot/u-boot.img ${D}/boot
    install -m 0644 ${WORKDIR}/package/boot/SPL ${D}/boot
    install -m 0644 ${WORKDIR}/package/boot/uEnv.txt ${D}/boot
}

sysroot_stage_all_append () {
    sysroot_stage_dir ${D}/boot ${SYSROOT_DESTDIR}/boot
}


But it didn't succeed.

Thanks for any help you may provide.

Sincerely,

Jean-Pierre Doyon
