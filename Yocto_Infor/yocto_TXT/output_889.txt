This file was forked from the generic (non verity) version in
meta-yocto, but it would seem that due to limited use, an update
in the parent never made it here, even after two years:

[commit 0c679ac53b52e631a7c961872ce58f5cf74b8629 in meta-yocto]

  Subject: [PATCH] meta-yocto-bsp: beaglebone: Set a fixed size for boot
   partition in WIC image

  After the dosfstools has been updated to v4.2 by commit b522f24723e1
  ("dosfstools: update 4.1 -> 4.2"), the commit b29eb5be67e9 ("mkfs.fat:
  Align total number of sectors to be multiple of sectors per track") in
  v4.2 has caused a regression in beagebone black board. The reason is
  that the real total sectors of the fat filesystem created by the mkdosfs
  may not be the same size as what we requested due to align with the
  sectors per track, this change seem no side effect to linux kernel,
  but it breaks the beaglebone black boot ROM and make it can't load the
  MLO. In order to fix this issue, we choose to set a fixed size for the
  boot partition to make sure that the total sectors always are aligned
  with the sectors per track.

  [Yocto #14306]

Bring the same change across, so dm-verity doesn't face the same
frustrating silent boot failure with zero console output.

With this change in place, and allowing for read-only rootfs, we see:

device-mapper: verity: sha256 using implementation "sha256-generic"
EXT4-fs (dm-0): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null). Quota mode: disabled.
INIT: version 3.01 booting

Note that the above is from booting on real hardware on Kirkstone.
