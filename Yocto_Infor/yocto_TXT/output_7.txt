Greetings!
I try to use gitsm fetcher to fetch bitbucket repository with read-only https access token. SRC_URI looks like this

This recipe fetches parent repository, but is unable to fetch submodule, writing fatal: could not read Username for 'https://tps-git.topcon.com': No such device or address in log.do_fetch
It happens because url is passed to fetcher function already with user string. I suggest a patch to fix this issue

Did you already consider to write the credentials in a  .netrc file?

I'm sorry but this is a known WONTFIX bug :
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13550
See : https://git.openembedded.org/bitbake/tree/lib/bb/fetch2/gitsm.py#n127

The only supported way to do this (that I know of) is to use .netrc as
Adrian suggested.

Adrian, Yoann,
Thank you very much and sorry for bringing it up.
.netrc does fix my problem.
