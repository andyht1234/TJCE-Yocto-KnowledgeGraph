HI Yocto Community,

I am currently working on build a custom Boot2Qt image to learn about
How-To's since it's my first time playing with Yocto. I am successfully
able to build an image for my system; manually inserting and launching my
Qt application works great.

Now I want to include this app and some files into the rootfs of the image.
I modified the recipe by adding the following lines at the end to attempt
this:

```
SRC_URI += " \
file://qtApp_qml \
file://startup.sh \
file://fb.modes \
"

do_install() {
  install -d ${D}/home/root
  install -m 755 ${WORKDIR}/qtApp_qml ${D}/home/root/

  install -d ${D}/etc/init.d
  install -m 755 ${WORKDIR}/startup.sh ${D}/etc/init.d/

  install -d ${D}/etc
  install -m 755 ${WORKDIR}/fb.modes ${D}/etc/
}

FILES_${PN} += " \
        /home/root/qtApp_qml \
        /etc/init.d/startup.sh \
        /etc/fb.modes \
"
```

But I'm simply unable to get those three files to show up at all in the
final build (both the folders and files!).

I've tried a few variations I saw around but still nothing. Any idea what's
missing?

Thanks!
Anthony

I am also a beginner but try adding S=${WORKDIR} and then building.

After this run bitbake recipe. If there are no errors, then  add the line CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_APPEND += “ recipe “ in local.conf folder.
Bitbake target

Run bitbake recipename
if it builds successfully then add the recipe to local.conf folder by appending the line CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += “ recipename “

Save and run bitbake target

I've tried a few variations I saw around but still nothing. Any idea what's missing?
Can you please elaborate on all variations you have tried.

I am also a beginner on yocto so my additions may not work, but give it a try and let me know once the files are loaded.

Hassan

Image recipes by default don't support SRC_URI or normal build related
tasks/configs. Thus it's better to have a custom recipe to build the
sources into binary packages, which then can be added to the image
via IMAGE_INSTALL variable, see
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#customizing-images

That said, this trick will enable SRC_URI handling in image recipes:

python __anonymous() {
    d.delVarFlag("do_fetch", "noexec")
    d.delVarFlag("do_unpack", "noexec")
}

My use case for this was image specific config files for tests, which
are really specific to images and which don't belong to any other SW
component/recipe.

Cheers,

-Mikko

Ignore my previous posts Ive made some mistakes there.
1) Create a custom recipe file.

Run bitbake recipename
If it runs successfully,  then add the below in your local.conf folder.
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL_append += " recipename "

Would it be possible for you to share what changes you have tried. To be honest I am a beginner too and want too learn more, so I got curious.
Also the above will most probably work, but in case you solve it with any other method, then please post here for other's reference.

My guess is that you are on a recent release, which as changed syntax. To
add files to packages, you need:

FILES:${PN} += ...

But I agree with the other responders, please be as precise as possible.
Name your used versions please, for one thing.
The other part is that things will not be added to an image automatically
just because you wrote a recipe. You have to add them explicitly. Its a bit
dated by now, but I think most of this is explained in the various
livecoding sessions:

Hi,

Thank you all for your contribution to this thread.
Following this, here's what I have tried so far that HAS NOT worked.
1. The initial code of this post as a separate recipe.
2. The initial code of this post as a .bbappend.
3. The example shown here:
http://embeddedguruji.blogspot.com/2019/02/yocto-recipe-to-copy-single-file-on.html
4. The format of the recipe as shown here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62635557/add-files-to-system-image-in-yocto
5. Other similar scripts around StackOverflow

Basically, none of them showed usage of adding the S=${WORKDIR} line.

Upon using it, the files transferred to the rootfs build successfully.

First thing I tried was the following recipe with an absolute path:

```
SUMMARY = "filesystem"
DESCRIPTION = "Copy gui and relevant scripts"
LICENSE = "CLOSED"

inherit allarch

MY_FILES =
/home/<user>/oe-core/layers/meta-custom-gui/recipes-gui/gui/files"

do_install() {

install -d {D}/etc

install -m 0755 ${MY_FILES}/fb.modes ${D}/etc

# Same thing for other files

}

FILES_${PN} += " \

/etc \

# Same thing for other files

"

Then in build/local.conf: CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += " filesystem "
```

And this recipe worked.
So I figured it probably has to do with the pathing, so rewrote my initial
code by adding S=${WORKDIR} like you all suggested, here is my final
working recipe.

```
SUMMARY = "filesystem"
DESCRIPTION = "Copy gui and relevant scripts"
LICENSE = "CLOSED"

SRC_URI += " \

file://qt_app \

file://startup.sh \

file://fb.modes \

"

S = "${WORKDIR}"

do_install() {

install -d 0644 ${D}/home/root

install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/qt_app ${D}/home/root

install -d 0644 ${D}/etc/init.d

install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/startup.sh ${D}/etc/init.d


install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/fb.modes ${D}/etc

}

FILES_${PN} += " \

/home/root/qt_app \

/etc/init.d/startup.sh \

/etc/fb.modes \

"

Then in build/local.conf: CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_APPEND += " filesystem "
```

So a few observations and follow-up questions on this:
1. Adding S=${WORKDIR} did the trick. Why is that? I don't use S anywhere
in my do_install().
2. In order to copy a bash script, I had to add RDEPENDS_${PN} += " bash "
to this secondary recipe.
3. In order to copy my Qt app, I also had to add its Qt dependencies as in
(2). Why do I need everything's dependencies even if I only wish to do a
copy in the rootfs?
4. Some of you have been suggesting adding the recipe to
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL or CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_APPEND. Both give me the same
result. Is there a fundamental difference?
4. To setup Yocto, I used Toradex's manifest for the Dunfell version, which
uses Yocto v3.1 LTS since I'm working on an Apalis iMX6 board:
https://developer.toradex.com/linux-bsp/os-development/build-yocto/build-a-reference-image-with-yocto-projectopenembedded

Thank you all again and I hope this helps others.
Anthony

Hi,

Thank you all for your contribution to this thread.
Following this, here's what I have tried so far that HAS NOT worked.
1. The initial code of this post as a separate recipe.
2. The initial code of this post as a .bbappend.
3. The example shown here:
http://embeddedguruji.blogspot.com/2019/02/yocto-recipe-to-copy-single-file-on.html
4. The format of the recipe as shown here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62635557/add-files-to-system-image-in-yocto
5. Other similar scripts around StackOverflow

Basically, none of them showed usage of adding the S=${WORKDIR} line.

Upon using it, the files transferred to the rootfs build successfully.

First thing I tried was the following recipe with an absolute path:

```
SUMMARY = "filesystem"
DESCRIPTION = "Copy gui and relevant scripts"
LICENSE = "CLOSED"

inherit allarch

MY_FILES =
/home/<user>/oe-core/layers/meta-custom-gui/recipes-gui/gui/files"

do_install() {
    install -d {D}/etc
    install -m 0755 ${MY_FILES}/fb.modes ${D}/etc
    # Same thing for other files
}

FILES_${PN} += " \
    /etc \
    # Same thing for other files
"

Then in build/local.conf: CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += " filesystem "
```

And this recipe worked.
So I figured it probably has to do with the pathing, so rewrote my initial
code by adding S=${WORKDIR} like you all suggested, here is my final
working recipe.

```
SUMMARY = "filesystem"
DESCRIPTION = "Copy gui and relevant scripts"
LICENSE = "CLOSED"

SRC_URI += " \
    file://qt_app \
    file://startup.sh \
    file://fb.modes \
"

S = "${WORKDIR}"

do_install() {
    install -d 0644 ${D}/home/root
    install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/qt_app ${D}/home/root
    install -d 0644 ${D}/etc/init.d
    install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/startup.sh ${D}/etc/init.d
    install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/fb.modes ${D}/etc
}

FILES_${PN} += " \
    /home/root/qt_app \
    /etc/init.d/startup.sh \
    /etc/fb.modes \
"

Then in build/local.conf: CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_APPEND += " filesystem "
```

So a few observations and follow-up questions on this:
1. Adding S=${WORKDIR} did the trick. Why is that? I don't use S anywhere
in my do_install().
2. In order to copy a bash script, I had to add RDEPENDS_${PN} += " bash "
to this secondary recipe.
3. In order to copy my Qt app, I also had to add its Qt dependencies as in
(2). Why do I need everything's dependencies even if I only wish to do a
copy in the rootfs?
4. Some of you have been suggesting adding the recipe to
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL or CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_APPEND. Both give me the same
result. Is there a fundamental difference?
4. To setup Yocto, I used Toradex's manifest for the Dunfell version, which
uses Yocto v3.1 LTS since I'm working on an Apalis iMX6 board:
https://developer.toradex.com/linux-bsp/os-development/build-yocto/build-a-reference-image-with-yocto-projectopenembedded

Thank you all again and I hope this helps others.
Anthony
