Hi,
Working on Yocto build system first time.
I has written a recipe to fetch the code from private GIT HUB, using SSH keys. Able to clone the code using git clone.
However when i ran bitbake getting below error.
"ssh couldnot resolve host"

In my bitbake recipe these two line are present
SRCREV = "ed189c8f5a4df7xxxxxxxxxxx4d443c382f4578"
SRC_URI = "git://git@xxxx.com:xxx/xxx.git"

Could someone please suggest on how to write a recipe to get the application code from private git hub using SSH keys.

Regards,
Vijay

Hello,

The ':' in SRC_URI is not handled like in the git clone command line. You
may need to change it to a '/'
SRC_URI = "git://git@xxxx.com/xxx/xxx.git;protocol=ssh;"

This is a frequent error (I make it at least once per project)

Hope this helps!
