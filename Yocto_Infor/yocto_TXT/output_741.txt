Greetings,

I try to enable Vulkan on Aarch64 client another time. I added " vulkan" to DISTRO_FEATURES:append in local.conf and I try to add the venus-experimental=true flag to virglrenderer's bb file. But compiling virglrenderer doesn't work, it spits a linker error agains libvulkan. When I add "vulkan" in REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES it claims 'vulkan' was not in DISTRO_FEATURES.

Any ideas?

Regards
