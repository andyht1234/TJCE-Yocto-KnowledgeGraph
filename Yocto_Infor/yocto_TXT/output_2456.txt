Hi Yocto Devs,

I have this issue when I want to generate a SDK for our custom distro. We require the use of debian package due to historic reasons so the package management has been enabled, 
where the package class is package_deb. Now I get a lot of dependency errors from APT when generating the SDK.

I will not place the complete list here due to it's length but I got the following:

-- The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 bzip2-dev : Depends: bzip2 (= 1.0.8-r0) but it is not going to be installed
             Recommends: libbz2-dev but it is not installable
             Recommends: update-alternatives-opkg-dev but it is not installable
 curl-dev : Depends: curl (= 7.75.0-r0) but it is not going to be installed
            Recommends: libcurl-dev but it is not installable
 e2fsprogs-dev : Depends: e2fsprogs (= 1.46.1-r0) but it is not going to be installed
                 Depends: libss
                 Recommends: attr-dev but it is not going to be installed
                 Recommends: autoconf-archive-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: e2fsprogs-badblocks-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: e2fsprogs-dumpe2fs-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: libcomerr-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: libe2p-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: libext2fs-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: libss-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: update-alternatives-opkg-dev but it is not installable
 libgmp-dev : Depends: libgmpxx
              Recommends: libgmpxx-dev but it is not installable
 libgnutls-dev : Depends: gnutls-openssl
                 Depends: gnutls-xx
                 Recommends: gnutls-openssl-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: gnutls-xx-dev but it is not installable
 mosquitto-dev : Depends: libmosquittopp1 but it is not going to be installed
                 Recommends: libcrypto-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: libmosquitto1-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: libmosquittopp1-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: libssl-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: libsystemd-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: shadow-sysroot-dev but it is not installable
                 Recommends: uthash-dev but it is not going to be installed
<A lot more items here.>
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt --fix-broken install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

If I add the depending packages as a IMAGE_INSTALL_append then it seem to be resolved, but still the mossquitto-dev or curl-dev package is still not present within the SDK sysroots environment.
That leads me to think that I did something wrong or something is broken?

I found on the internet some pointer to remove the package_deb for the SDK generation (so it will fallback to package_rpm), but that increases the build times significantly (which is not desirable).

Can anyone give me some pointers into resolving this behavior?

With kind regards,
