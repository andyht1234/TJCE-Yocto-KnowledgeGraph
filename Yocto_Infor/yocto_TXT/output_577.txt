        Attempting to add feeds with some special names that match
        architecture names was returning an error:
        "5   The named feed already exists"
        Make sourceTypePattern in createFeedLineRegex only match
        feed configuration lines src or dist

ACK; looks good to me.

I'll pull this tomorrow, if there are no objections.
