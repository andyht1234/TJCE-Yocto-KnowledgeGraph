Hi folks,

I'm unable to make updates to the meta-linux-mainline layer on the layer
index. It still has an old email address in the maintainer field which I
no longer have access to.

The layer can be seen on the dunfell branch here:
https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/dunfell/layer/meta-linux-mainline/

Is it possible to update the layer index so that the current details are 
used?

Repository URL: https://github.com/unnecessary-abstraction/meta-linux-mainline
Maintainer email: paul@pbarker.dev

Thanks,

-- 
Paul Barker

I've made the changes, please check. there is still some old data,
hopefully it will be fixed when the index is updated.

Thanks Nico!
