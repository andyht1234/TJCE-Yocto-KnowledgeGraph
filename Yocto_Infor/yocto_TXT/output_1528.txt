Hi,

I've two image recipes ( foo.bb ( http://foo.bb/ ) & bar.bb ( http://bar.bb/ ) ). I want to add INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE="GPLv3" only in foo.bb ( http://foo.bb/ ) & not bar.bb ( http://bar.bb/ )

Adding INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE=" GPLv3" in local.conf is applying it on both the images. So I tried this instead,

INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE_pn-foo=" GPLv3"

But this also isn't working. Is there any other way for this?
NOTE : The recipes are image recipes, not packages

Cheers,
Priyanshu Sharma
