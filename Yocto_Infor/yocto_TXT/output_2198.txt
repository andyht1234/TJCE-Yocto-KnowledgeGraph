Hello All,

I am facing an issue while building images for Raspberry Pi CM4. Earlier I was working with Dunfell release and now upgraded to Honister. And now I am getting an error like:

.
.
checking whether mkdir handles trailing slash... yes
checking whether mkdir handles trailing dot... yes
checking for mkfifo... yes
checking whether mkfifo rejects trailing slashes... yes
checking whether mknod can create fifo without root privileges... configure: error: in `/home/raspcm4/build-rauc/tmp-glibc/work/x86_64-linux/coreutils-native/8.32-r0/build':
configure: error: you should not run configure as root (set FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1 in environment to bypass this check)
See `config.log' for more details
NOTE: The following config.log files may provide further information.
NOTE: /home/raspcm4/build-rauc/tmp-glibc/work/x86_64-linux/coreutils-native/8.32-r0/build/config.log
ERROR: configure failed
WARNING: exit code 1 from a shell command.
.
.

I have set "export FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1" but still getting same error.

I am building from "/home/ dir and not "/root/" dir.

Can someone please let me know how to resolve this issue?

Your help will be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Are you running bitbake as root?
