Hello,

In my rootfs, I have busybox without shell support (because I’m using
bash), but I want an initramfs with busybox with shell support.

I saw some quite old messages, saying that for this specific case, one
should duplicate the busybox recipe. But this has caveat and does not seem
to be a clean solution. So I decided to use a multiconfig, which seems to
be the ideal solution for that case.

Here’s what I did.

First, I created a multiconfig/initramfs.conf file in my private layer
containing:

TMPDIR = "${TOPDIR}/tmp-initramfs"
BUSYBOX_MY_INITRAMFS_CONFIG = "-initramfs"

Then, I created a busybox_%.bbappend with this content:

SRC_URI += "file://fragment.cfg;subdir=busybox-${PV}"
BUSYBOX_MY_INITRAMFS_CONFIG ?= ""
FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend :=
"${THISDIR}/${BPN}${BUSYBOX_MY_INITRAMFS_CONFIG}:"

First question: is this the right way to create and use a custom variable?
I want the recipe to choose the good fragment depending on
BUSYBOX_MY_INITRAMFS_CONFIG, but I’m not sure it is really working.

After that, I added the following line in distro.conf:

BBMULTICONFIG = "initramfs"

Second question: documents state that this variable should be in
local.conf, but it seems to also work in distro.conf; am I correct or is it
creating unwanted side effects?

In the same distro.conf, I also added:

INITRAMFS_IMAGE = "core-image-minimal-initramfs"
INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE = "1"
INITRAMFS_SCRIPTS = "initramfs-module-rootfs-update"
INITRAMFS_MULTICONFIG = "initramfs"
INITRAMFS_DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE =
"${TOPDIR}/tmp-initramfs/deploy/images/${MACHINE}"

If I understand well, it should make the building of the kernel depend on
the multiconfig initramfs:core-image-minimal-initramfs. But it is not
working.

First of all, I am spammed with messages like:

NOTE: Deferred task
mc:initramfs:/home/stephane/Developpements/yocto/sources/poky/meta/recipes-devtools/qemu/qemuwrapper-cross_1.0.bb:do_package_qa
now buildable
NOTE: Deferred task
mc:initramfs:virtual:native:/home/stephane/Developpements/yocto/sources/poky/meta/recipes-devtools/opkg/opkg_0.6.1.bb:do_populate_sysroot
now buildable

Other point, it seems to build a full image in the initramfs configuration,
while I expected that it would only build the initramfs image. My first
attempt (when the tmp-initramfs directory was empty) took ages to build and
I saw it tried to build the Linux kernel in it.

And on top of that, it fails because when building the kernel for initramfs
configuration, it cannot find the initramfs image. Which sounds logical,
because it is currently building the initramfs. So there seem to be a kind
of circular dependencies…

I’d be glad if someone could tell me what I’m doing wrong.
