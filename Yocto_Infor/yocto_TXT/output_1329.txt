Hi,

We have a C++ projects configured by CMake.

Our CMake files download some dependencies from our git by standard "git
clone" command during configure phase.

If I add our project as a recipe to Yocto the git command always fails with
exit code 128 (resource unavailable - no internet connection, protocol not
supported etc.).

What's wrong? How Can I solve this problem? In a standard env the configure
proceeds without problems.

We use
- Yocto >= 4,
- Bitbake >= 2,
- Ubuntu 20.04 as a host system

Src URI spec:

SRCREV = "<commit_id>"SRC_URI = gitsm://<path_to_git>;protocol=ssh;nobranch=1



Thanks a lot for your advice :)
John

yes cmake has the downloader module which perhaps is good from
development point of view, however, with yocto where one goal is about
reproducibility its important to have
sourcecode immutable and ensure that all of it is available before
system goes ahead with building it. Therefore recently bitbake has
started disabling network access after fetching
task is finished, just so that it does not get modified under it
without notice. One approach is to use git submodules in your project
instead of doing it with cmake then use gitsm fetcher
in yocto and you have best of both worlds.

Hello,

Thanks for a prompt reply.

Can you point me to the correct loc. in documentation? I cannot find it :(.
(just for the future that so I can read a doc properly... :) )

Thanks a lot
