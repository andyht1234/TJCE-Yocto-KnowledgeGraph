Hello,

What can I do to move this patch along - or did I miss anything?  
Apologies for my ignorance, it's my first time submitting a patch to YP.

I can't see the patch in the mailing list archives:

https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/topics?

only your reply:

https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/topic/patch/84387478?

so I don't think the original patch made it to the list? Since I never
saw it there, I couldn't apply it!

Cheers,

Richard

From: Richard Elberger <elberger@amazon.com>

This patch provides the buildbot system to make the aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2.
- build on poky
- meta-openembedded and meta-aws are additional repo dependencies
- build for the two dominant architectures: x86-64 and arm64.
