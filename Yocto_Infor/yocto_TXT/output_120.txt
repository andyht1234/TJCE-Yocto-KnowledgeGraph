Key Status/Updates:

   -

   YP 4.3 M3 rc1 was released and work is being done on the autobuilder QA
   email step to improve for future releases. The regression report is still
   being worked on.
   -

   YP 3.1.28 is under review for release
   -

   YP 4.0.13 rc2 is in QA
   -

   The numpy reproducibility issue remains and is proving extremely
   problematic with many failed builds. We may have to merge the debug patch
   into master.
   -

   The openssh ptest intermittent failure does have better logs available
   but we’ve yet to decode what it means:

http://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/20230917-2/testresults/qemuarm64-ptest/openssh.log

   -

   The changes to error for overlapping symlinks under sstate control have
   highlighted some issues, particularly in world build configurations however
   so far these have proven to be real issues that needed addressing in the
   configuration as the files overlapped and caused determinism issues.
   -

   The number of build failures from incoming patches remains high and is
   causing patch review delays and headaches for the maintainers. We are not
   here to debug people’s patches, we’re only meant to be catching
   accidental/occasional issues.
   -

   Patches for enabling wider SPDX tooling and testing in core are being
   proposed but there are quite a few python module dependencies. We do have
   good tooling/class support for python modules so the maintenance overhead
   of these is relatively low but the number of modules in core has increased
   steadily. Feedback welcome.
   -

   Since the 6.4 kernel is already EOL, we are considering a 6.5 kernel for
   4.3 as the best of several difficult options.
   -

   The project is working on improving its security processes and policies,
   there are emails on the mailing list discussing this. Please highlight
   these to any parties who may be interested or have useful feedback.


Ways to contribute:

   -

   As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components which
   are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying to
   keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex, devtool,
   toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more. Many
   have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
   components!
   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.

   appreciated.
