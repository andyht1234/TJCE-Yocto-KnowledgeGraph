Do we really want to have Zephyr on a release candidate?  IMHO, we
should never be doing this, as we should want the kernel in
meta-zephyr to be as stable as possible.  If this is really desired,
perhaps a master-next branch for things like this.

Thanks,
Jon

My recommendation would be to pull that patch out and apply it
directly on top of v2.5.0 (assuming that is feasible).  Maybe even
asking the upstream zephyr project to port this to v2.5.0 and make it
v2.5.1 would be the optimal solution.

As far as a master-next branch, that would be up to Naveen.

[Naveen]  We can wait for stable release. If it is urgent, we can carry patches for bug fixes,  in case upstream does not give dot release !

Hello everybody, thanks for your comments.

Let's abandon this patch then. Judging by meta-zephyr commit history we
guessed that bumping up the rev to -rc is compliant with your policy. In
that case we, as meta-zephyr users, will just wait for the upstream to
reach stable 2.6.0.

Regards,
Wojciech

Even if we don't have the 2.6.0-rc1 release default (to which I agree), I still think having support for it (as a non default) is beneficial. Especially given that 2.6.0 will be an LTS so people might want early (opt-in) support for the time being.
