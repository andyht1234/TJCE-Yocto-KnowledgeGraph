Can someone tell me is this supported under Yocto in any way?

meta-beignet/recipes-opencl at ross * rossburton/meta-beignet * GitHub<https://github.com/rossburton/meta-beignet/tree/ross/recipes-opencl>

Any docs, or updates ?

Wanted to know if this would work under Zeus, with meta-clang ?
Looking to build opencl shared library support...

Thanks,
Steve

Yes, please see the compute-runtime recipe that builds NEO driver instead for later platforms. More details on the project site:
