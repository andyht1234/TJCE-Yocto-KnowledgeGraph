I'm trying to sort out how to install a pre-built host-only tool for native
and nativesdk only.

Using `inherit native` my-recipe-native and nativesdk-my-recipe both build
fine, only -c populate_sdk generates "rdepends upon non-existent task
do_package_write_rpm".  Looking at native.bbclass it includes `inherit
nopackage` which explains the error.

If I remove the `inherit native` and update my recipe name to not include
`-native` I can build the -native version, only I can't build
nativesdk-*-native.  A target build is invalid.

What is the recommended pattern to do this, and is there an example of this
anywhere?


Thanks,
Joel
