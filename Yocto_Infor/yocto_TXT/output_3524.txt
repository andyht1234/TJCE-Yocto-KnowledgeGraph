I'm using the OpenBMC system (https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc) and
I've tried to enable AppArmor functionality from the 'meta-security'
layer.

To achieve this I've added these strings to my local.conf file:
DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " apparmor"
IMAGE_INSTALL += "apparmor"

The AppArmor functionality was installed to my image, but
unfortunately I've come to this issue:

From the way I see it the problems start from this output:
xargs: invalid option -- 'd'

This error comes from a fact that `xargs` from the `busybox` doesn't
have the `-d` option
(https://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/findutils/xargs.c)
but this functionality is used in the file:
https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-security/tree/recipes-mac/AppArmor/files/functions

Once I've discovered it, I started to wonder if I'm doing everything correctly.
Is my issue a simple bug, or AppArmor is not supposed to be run in an
environment like mine?

Busybox implementation of xargs does not support specifying a delimiter.

I suggest you to install the full-featured xargs which is provided by
the findutils recipe.

You probably need to disable xargs Busybox implementation otherwise
there'll be a conflict (you'll know, Yocto won't create the image).

Cheers,
Quentin

I've added `IMAGE_INSTALL += "findutils"` to my `conf/local.conf`
file, and it seems like it was enough. There weren't any build
conflicts.

Should the AppArmor recipe be upgraded in some way to indicate that it
needs a full-featured findutils package instead of a busybox one?

I think it will be useful to dig a bit further and find out what option
does it need from findutils package sometimes this could be solved by using
compatible options etc

If we find out that it has hard dependency on findutils then it should be
added to apparmor recipe RDEPENDS

You are using systemd.

There is a comment regarding coreutils and findutils

|# Add coreutils and findutils only if sysvinit scripts are in use

Patches welcome.

Not sure to really understand the question, but the -d option of xargs
is for specifying a delimiter different than the default space.

There is no support for such a thing in Busybox implementation of
xargs. Usually options for tools in Busybox are specified at the
beginning of the C file:
https://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/findutils/xargs.c
Line 17 to 71.

If one looks for delimiter keyword in the file, nothing configurable is
available, it's either space or EOF that is matched.

I'm naive enough to think it might be not too hard to add this option to\
Busybox implementation.

Cheers,
Quentin
