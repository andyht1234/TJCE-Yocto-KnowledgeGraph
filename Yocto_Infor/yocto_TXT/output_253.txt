Dear community,
I need to build a recipe which does not now, which actual version the
source file(s) has.

So is it possible, to pick up a version preliminary from either
environment, the content of an existing auxiliary file or from the
structure of the source file itself?

Say, if theres is something like bla-1.23.jar I could look vor a jar
beginning with bla, suffix .jar and construct 1.23 as ${PV} to use in
the SRC_URI. Also possible is to provide a file with version info to be
read or prepare the ENV.

Kind Regards
Konstantin

You probably need to explain the use case. Why do you want to do
something like that?

Generally, Yocto cares about build reproducibility, a lot. Thus,
source must be stable, and verified against a checksum of some kind.

The yocto build is happening in a gitlab runner thingy.

What happens before is that inedependently from the yocto build is that
my colleauges are running a maven build which provides java jar files.

And I do not know on my side what version they are doing. It could
happen even that it alternates between X.Y.Z and X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT.

Then my yocto comes and is picking those jars up and integrates them into
the rootfs to be started there by java. They are not processed or
executed or compiled, they are copied into the rootfs, symlinkd and
integrated into a systemd start.

Colleauges maven build: Their git tree.
Yocto build: My git tree.

I learned to love its build reliability because of such stuff too.

Hi,

I am not sure how well this would work for JARs (especially if they are large).

But you may be able to drop the as-built JARs into a git repo and commit them.

Then make use of the GIT AUTOREV facility to fetch from that GIT repo.

Each time you build after your GIT repo changes, will be built on the newer rev.

If your version info used to derive PV is in that GIT repo (rather than say date based) so that it stays the same after each rebuild of the same GIT rev (and only changes when the GIT rev is changed as part of new commits), you may still be able to satisfy the repeatable build (at least repeatable when rebuilt multiple times with your GIT repo at the same revision.

I would suggest that for releases where you may want to tag your Yocto GIT repo, you set the SRCREV to a specific revision so that a rebuild of the release is based on the exact same JARs.  (i.e. just use the autorev while doing development).

If this doesnâ€™t work for GIT, you could always try with an alternate revision control system for which Yocto has autorev support.



Regards,

Darcy

I think the easiest would be to run a shell script prior to starting
bitbake, which would check what jar needs to be used, and write the
SRC_URI with the name and the checksum into a .inc file in the
meta-layer. Then there's a static .bb file that would include the
.inc, and do the installation/packaging. Changes to .inc would then be
under version control and thus reproducible.

Interesting idea which I will track in the future, thank you very much!

Thanks for this extermely helpful advice I did not think of.

I made a shell script, inspecting the jar files and extracting the
version with a regexp from the filename.

This is injected as PV into a inc file the latter bb recipe require.
This way the inc contains only PV, the bb recipe is fix.

The shell script is invoked from the outer build brocess between maven
and bitbake.

Many thanks!
Kind Regards
Konstantin
