  a friend of mine is diving into trying to boot linux on a meta-riscv
linux starter kit -- he's not using YP, and this is what he's
targeting:

  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003751298305.html

  since i've wanted to jump into meta-riscv for a while, i figured i'd
play along and ordered something more substantial:

  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002796061251.html

in any event, here's the story so far.

  as a first pass, i just fired up YP and built for qemuriscv64 to
establish a baseline, and that seems to work just fine, booting with
"runqemu nographic." and that at least gives me a bunch of config info
i can look at later.

  as for my actual target board, i know that the meta-riscv layer
defines support for two boards, neither of which is the one i will be
getting, but while i'm waiting for it, i can at least start
documenting all of the relevant settings and config values i'll want
to try.

  i know precious little about meta-riscv, so is there a sane way to
prepare for the eventual arrival of my board? my plan is to get
familiar with how the meta-riscv layer builds for the two supported
boards, so i'll have a handle on what i'll need to configure.

  any further advice would be most appreciated.

We should add them to meta-riscv as reference BSPs. I have port
of unmatched locally and have been trying to get the needed changes
into meta-sifive which is still pending.

  so you have working BSPs for both of those? very cool. warning that
i know effectively nothing about RISC-V but this is apparently my
weekend project to dig into it. i don't see a meta-riscv-specific
mailing list, so i assume if i want to start sending simple patches
for meta-riscv, they would go here?

  already built and tested qemuriscv64, so i guess i'll work backwards
from there and examine the configuration and construction of the
components. opensbi, here we come ...

Usually we use GitHub issues and pulls
