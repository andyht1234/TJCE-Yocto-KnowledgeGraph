Hi All,

As the project develops, some tests are valuable and some become less valuable
over time.

When we first started reproducible builds work, testing reproducibility heavily
across multiple distros highlighted some unusual bugs and let us improve things.
We therefore currently run a-full with the targets:

reproducibile-centos
reproducibile-debian
reproducibile-fedora
reproducibile-ubuntu

I've noticed we pretty much always see the same set of failures with these
targets now, i.e. if one fails, they all fail the same way.

Those targets are heavy builds which don't reuse sstate for one of the build
streams and hence load the autobuilder heavily.

I'm thinking they've served their purpose and that a-full should go back to just
the randomly selected reproduiclbe target.

Does anyone feel we shouldn't do that?

Cheers,

Richard

I support this.  It has been quite some time since dunfell encountered
a distro specific reproducibility issue.

I agree. I assume the change is simple enough to make that we can
bring them back easily if we think it might be helpful is some
scenario?

Also, just to clarify, those workers will still contribute to the
initial sstate, so they will still help find cross-host reproducible
problems, they just might not find it themselves?

Yes, I'll leave the targets available, we'd just run them manually or re-enable
them but I'd take them off a-full for now.

Correct, yes.

With this change, what are the remaining differences between a-full and a-quick?

There is quite a bit of difference. oe-selftest on multiple distros vs a single
one. It triggers several more minor builds (e.g. edrouter-alt, qemux86-world-
alt, ltp targets), runs full ptests rather than ptest-fast, some of the other
layers  and has the toolchain testing too.

Cheers,

Richard
