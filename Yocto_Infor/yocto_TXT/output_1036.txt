Hello all,
I'm in the process of generating an image without GPLv3 software. I have removed everything but the gcc-runtime and libgcc libraries. These are gpl-3.0 with GCC exception. I'm not sure how feasible it is to remove these or replace them with llvm replacements. Just wondering if anyone had been down this path before and if you can share your experience that would be great!

Thanks

The GCC exception frees you from having to fulfil the terms of gpl3 in
almost all cases. Links with details are easily obtainable with google
search.

Thanks for the response!
I did try googling the interpretation of the license exception but
there are always back-and-forth debates on the issue.
Anyways, consulting with the legal team came back with the inclusion
of these libraries would still trigger the "installation information"
clause. For this reason, I'm investigating the feasibility of
replacing these libraries completely.

This is literally the first time I hear about gcc exception not being good
enough. Your legal team holds the ultimate authority, but itâ€™s most
certainly not common practice. How did they justify it?

You can do it to certain extent with meta-clang. Select RUNTIME =
"llvm" in local.conf after including it. However, this is not going to
be drop-in replacement due to some packages ( e.g. glibc )
still not buildable with llvm + llvm-runtime and there are more
components depending upon what you distro uses it might be more to
consider. Its perhaps easier to get C++ runtime using libc++
than say replacing libgcc and crt init files, which might need more work.

Changing gcc to clang should be done for technical reasons, I would
rather not give this advice to address what seems like an incomplete
understanding of the licensing situation.

One more thought: would shipping gcc-runtime also trigger the 'provide
the source code for everything that has been linked with it' then as
required by all gpl versions? The exception frees you from that too,
so why is it good enough for one requirement of the gpl, but not the
other?

I was merely replying to question about if llvm could replace it. For
licensing related question I refrain because I donâ€™t have expertise in that
itâ€™s best to consult some one who knows this stuff and understands it.
Least I will misguide someone
