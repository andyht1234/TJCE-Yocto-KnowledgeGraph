This allows all versions of Bitbake and Yocto Project manuals
to see the manuals for the latest versions.

This also simplifies the release process, not having to update the
releases.rst file for all releases every time a new release is made.

Note that such synchronization is already done for the
switchers.js file (but in a different way). This way, advertised
releases are in sync with switchers.js.

Hi Quentin,

Thanks for the review and for your suggestions.

I tried, but I stumble on the need to copy the latest switchers.js from
yocto-docs to the Bitbake branches too.

And since the Bitbake branches need to be checked out and processed
first, I hesitate to add a special extra step to checkout the yocto-docs
repo before. Possible but adding complexity.

So, if I don't use this way for the Bitbake branches, I still need a
find command at the end...

If you don't think about any better idea, I'd propose to stick to this
version of the patch.

Cheers
Michael.
