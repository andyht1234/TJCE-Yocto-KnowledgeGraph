Hi, is there a way to get yocto to "deploy" the wheels for python packages?

At the moment I can only find .deb artifacts, I would like to have "tmp/deploy/whl" (or some other)
folder in which to find all wheels for python packages generated in the build.

Is there some standard way to do this? Is it even possible without writing a custom recipe for each
package?

You can write a class to do that, and inherit it in all the recipes that you want to have wheels.
