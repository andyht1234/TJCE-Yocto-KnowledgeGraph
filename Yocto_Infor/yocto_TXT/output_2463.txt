Hi Team,


I am trying to build radius server with the use of Yocto project and looks
like freeradius recipe is already included in
meta-openembedded/meta-networking/recipes-connectivity/freeradius


I have included meta-openembedded layer in my conf/bblayers.conf file and
built core-image-base image.


But I couldn't see anything related to radius server in my <workspace>/tmp
directory


"tmp/work/ccimx6ul/core-image-base/1.0-r0/rootfs/etc/init.d"


Could you please let me know do I need to add anything specific to build
radius server apart from using meta-openembedded recipe? I apologize if
this is the wrong mailing list.


Thanks much!


Best Regards

Rakesh kumar

just adding layer is not enough, you have to add it to your image as well via
IMAGE_INSTALL or some other way as indirect dependency
