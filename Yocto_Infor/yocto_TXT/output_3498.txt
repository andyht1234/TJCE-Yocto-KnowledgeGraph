I wonder what are all possible criteria for Bitbake to decide to skip recipe (please compare to reports delivered by bitbake-layers). Recipe overlay, recipe version, others? Which knowledge source to find more details in?

I'm not aware of a specific list but two that come to mind are,
(in meta-openembedded):

$ rgrep PNBLACKLIST meta-*| wc -l
10
$ rgrep COMPATIBLE_HOST meta-*| wc -l
115


Maybe you can explain why you want to know why bitbake would skip a
recipe and that will help us to help you.

Thanks for input.
In meantime certain time ago, I guess there were different types of bitbake-layers output
(I has short opportunity to analyze) which comment several number of packages/recipes
by "recipe skipped" or something like this.
I like to be able to interpret that information properly, what's behind recipe skipped.
