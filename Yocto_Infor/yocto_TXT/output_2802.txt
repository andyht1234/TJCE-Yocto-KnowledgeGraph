I searched the lists, layer index and the web but most of what I see is
that cross-compiling Julia is currently tricky:

https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/30338

We don't have a recipe for Julia in the layer index for it:
https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/recipes/?q=julia


Does anyone have a recipe that is a work in progress?
