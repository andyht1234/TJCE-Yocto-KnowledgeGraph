  the SRC_URI line:

  SRC_URI:append:nezha = " \ ...

seems odd since the machine name is actually "nezha-allwinner-d1", not
just "nezha". i checked and the two listed patches there don't appear
to be applied, for what i assume is just that reason.

  or is this somehow related to the "nezha.yml" file in the meta-riscv
layer?

This is a bug and this should be fixed to use full machine name for
override since we do not have nezha SoC override
