MACHINEOVERRIDES which are defined are not working for native recipe. Is this expected ? Is there any other way to use a machineoverride in native recipe.

Yes, it's expected.

native recipes shouldn't be MACHINE specific, so shouldn't use
MACHINEOVERRIDES, see:
meta/classes-recipe/native.bbclass:MACHINEOVERRIDES = ""
meta/classes-recipe/nativesdk.bbclass:MACHINEOVERRIDES = ""
