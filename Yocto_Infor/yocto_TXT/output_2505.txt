We are building yocto Zeus for the Raspberrypi 4. We are using a touchscreen on the system, and it works just fine. But if a keyboard or mouse is plugged in when the system boots then the touchscreen is disabled.

I am wondering if there is a configuration somewhere that can be set to allow both the touchscreen and an external keyboard at the same time?

I'm sorry if this is the wrong forum to ask this, please point me in the right direction if not.

Regards,
Greg Wilson-Lindberg
