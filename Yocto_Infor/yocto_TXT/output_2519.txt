Hello, I'm having some issue moving from an HDMI display to a USB 
display.

I figure out that I needed to enable these parameter in the kernel to 
use the USB monitor

CONFIG_DRM_UDL=y
CONFIG_FB_UDL=y

With those I'm able to see the terminal and login

However I'm still struggling and confused on how to get my GUI to show 
up with startx.

I don't know if I still need to install the displaylink driver since 
I've enabled UDL or if I need to set something with xorg to let him know 
to use the USB display.

I've tried to install the displaylink driver manually but I'm missing 
the DKMS component, not entirely sure what that is and how I would 
install this (or if I should).

I tried to follow some guide about displaylink with xorg and replacing 
it with udl and udlfb without success.

Thanks for your help

Simon
