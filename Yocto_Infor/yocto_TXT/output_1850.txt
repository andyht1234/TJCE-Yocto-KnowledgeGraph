Key Status/Updates:
 * YP 3.1.16 was released
 * YP 3.4.4 passed QA and has approval for release
 * We’ve continued to struggle with the git CVE fix issues and ended up
   changing the approach taken resolve it.
 * Whilst the git issue was breaking reproducible builds on the
   autobuilder, two other issues started occurring in reproducible
   builds, making clean builds hard to regain for master.
 * The update to gcc 12 has merged after clean test runs on the
   autobuilder. Thanks to Khem and Bruce for working though various
   issues in particular.
 * A lot of general version upgrades were merged bringing us more into
   sync with various upstreams, thanks Alex.
 * Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re
   continuing to see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

Ways to contribute:
 * There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
 * There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassign
   ed_Enhancements.2FBugs
 * We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
   list at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/incl
   ude/maintainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask
   on the OE-Core mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to
   “Unassigned” soon to help facilitate this.

Tip of the Week:
 * The scripts in ${WORKDIR}/temp/run.XXX for shell tasks can be
   quickly hacked and used for standalone debugging by replacing the
   function call at the end with “bash -i” which will then drop you
   into a shell environment matching the task being debugged (minus the
   fakeroot context). 
 * Bonus marks for anyone sending a patch to add the fakeroot context
   as comments at the start of the scripts.
 * (send any tips you’d like to see here to Stephen or Richard)
