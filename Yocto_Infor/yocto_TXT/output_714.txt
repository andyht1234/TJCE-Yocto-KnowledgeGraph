Hi guys,
If I want to add a nodejs application, how can I add  its necessary npm
packages. Do I have to create a folder containing all the packages source
files and install or build them with the application.
I have gone through the documentation and read about devtool but
didn't understand much about it.
It would be better if you can share some real time examples you've worked
on.
If you want to share your insights feel free to connect with me.

Thanks and Regards,
Hassan
