Under my aarm64 platform ../recipes-core/images I have a file "aiox-swdebugfs.inc"

Which basically contains:

EXTRAPATHS_prepend := "$(THISDIR}/files:"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"
SRC_URI += file://aiox-swdebugfs.cfg

I include this in my aiox-swdebugfs.bb like so: "require aiox-swdebugfs.inc"

It does not appear to apply my configuration fragments...
(CONFIG_SCHED_TRACER, CONFIG_TRACER, etc. for additional perf support)

I have the exact same implementation working under my intel platform.

Can someone tell me what I might be doing wrong, or how I can get my configuration fragments to be applied properly ?
Any ideas why it might work properly under one architecture and not on the other ?

Thanks,
Steve
