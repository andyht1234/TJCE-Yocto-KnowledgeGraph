Hi team,

I get this errorâ€¦

ERROR: Task do_build in /home/dwatkins/workspace/mgos/apollo17/upstream/yocto/poky/meta/recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal.bb depends upon non-existent task do_populate_cve_db in /home/dwatkins/workspace/mgos/apollo17/upstream/yocto/poky/meta/recipes-core/meta/cve-update-db-native.bb
ERROR: Command execution failed: 1

This commit below is reference from â€˜dunfellâ€™ branch but I see the same issue in â€˜masterâ€™ branch so I think it was back ported.

    cve-update-db-native: use fetch task



    Instead of inventing a new task to fetch the CVE data, use the existing

    fetch task.

Below is from isafw.bbclass (approx. line #108 in â€˜dunfellâ€™) in meta-security

do_build[depends] += "cve-update-db-native:do_populate_cve_db ca-certificates-native:do_populate_sysroot"

I think it needs to be â€¦

do_build[depends] += "cve-update-db-native:do_fetch ca-certificates-native:do_populate_sysroot"

I think this is as widespread in terms of backported branches, etc. as the original change went.  I am guessing that this doesnâ€™t impact users that are NOT using the meta-security layer.

I have to admit I was a bit surprised by this, but on the other hand, itâ€™s nice went I can suggest the fix rather than just belly ache over the issue.  ðŸ˜‰

Darcy
