Hi all,

after having sorted out all of my programatic-configuration issues I'm currently having an issue where I don't quite know what I'm doing wrong.

We use a too called "Delve" to debug applications on yocto remotely. This is an application built in Go.
https://github.com/go-delve/delve

However as soon as I try to build the layer I built for it, it fails.

The reason is that the repo contains one directory that only has test-classes and not a single "build"-class.

As the Go tooling seems to execute:

go list -f "{{.ImportPath}}" ./...

This also lists up that package and as soon as the yocto go tooling tries to build it, the build fails with:

| go build github.com/go-delve/delve/service/test: no non-test Go files in /home/cdutz/Projects/yocto/dunfell/build/tmp/work/aarch64-fslc-linux/delve/1.7.1-r0/build/src/github.com/go-delve/delve/service/test

A simple workaround is to simply create an empty go file with only a package in that directory, however this sort of feels like a workaround.

Is this possibly a bug in the Yocto Go tooling or am I doing someting stupid?

Chris
