I have a team that is looking at starting to use some of the 
recipes from meta-security and I am currently reviewing their 
changes to our layers. In a bbappend for tpm2-tools they 
removed the build dependency on tpm2-abrmd, which got me 
wondering why it was there in the first place. After doing 
some experimentation, I came up with the following patch:

diff --git a/meta-tpm/recipes-tpm2/tpm2-tools/tpm2-tools_5.5.bb b/meta-tpm/recipes-tpm2/tpm2-tools/tpm2-tools_5.5.bb

-# need tss-esys
-RDEPENDS:${PN} = "libtss2 tpm2-abrmd"

Motivation for the proposed changes above:

* The dependency on autoconf-archive is only needed when 
  building from the Git repository (and it should really be 
  autoconf-archive-native). This dependency can probably be 
  removed from more recipes that now build from tar balls 
  where they originally built from Git repositories.
* Removing the build dependency on tpm2-abrmd does not change 
  the output in any way, i.e., nothing is used from it.
* The runtime dependency on libtss2 is added automatically by 
  bitbake since /usr/bin/tpm2 is linked with libtss2-esys.so.0.
* The runtime dependency on tpm2-abrmd is AFAICT optional. And 
  in my book such dependencies are better handled at a higher 
  level, e.g., by depending on packagegroup-security-tpm2. If 
  it is removed, the instructions in meta-parsec/README.md that 
  references tpm2-tools may need to be complemented by a 
  reference to tpm2-abrmd. Similar for the runtime dependencies 
  in tpm2-pkcs11. An alternative to removing the runtime 
  dependency would be to instead introduce a PACKAGECONFIG for 
  it, but I do not like PACKAGECONFIGs that only add runtime 
  dependencies.

Bear in mind that I know nothing about tpm2. I am looking at 
this strictly from what is produced when building the recipe.

Comments?

Thanks for the write up and bringing it to my attention.
If you didn't know already, there are some basic QA tests for TPM2. I 
ran those with your changes above and they pass.
any plans of sending a patch?

BR,
Armin

Yes, I will. I just wanted to check if the above seemed correct to 
do first.
