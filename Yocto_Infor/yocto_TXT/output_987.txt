Hello!

I am working with Kirkstone release and need to add java openjdk-11.  I have a program which requires it.  From what I can find, the meta-java layer only supports openjdk-7 and openjdk-8.
I've looked through various forums with no luck.  Is there a recipe for openjdk-11?

Hoping somebody can  help!  Thanks.

David

Hi David,
unfortunately none I'm aware of.

But if you have time to add java 11 (or newer) support to meta-java I can give support/guidance.

regards;rl

Is there any interest in adding recipes that install pre-built Java binaries to meta-java? I needed a newer Java and the easy way was to make a recipe to install the Adoptium binaries: https://github.com/bobolopolis/meta-adoptium/blob/main/recipes-core/temurin/temurin-jdk-17-bin_17.0.6%2B10.bb

This was fine for my purposes, but obviously there’s tradeoffs to using someones pre-built binary. I can send a patch to add these to meta-java if it would be useful to others.

Thanks,
Robert

Sure, I can expand the recipe for additional architectures. A quick look at the other downloads shows they have builds for x86, x86-64, arm, aarch64, ppc64, sparcv9 and s390x. I don’t think Yocto supports sparc or s390, but accommodating the others should be straightforward. I should be able to get the time to put a patch together later this week.

Thanks,
Robert

I did send a patch back in February, but never got a response from Richard L:
https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-devel/message/100934

I’d still like to see it merged, but understand if it’s not what’s wanted in meta-java. I can certainly resend or make changes if desired.

Thanks,
Robert

Sorry, I've seen the patch and the discussion on it, but I'm currently
very busy with other things. I hope I get some time for this topic
within the next 2 weeks.

I'll come back to you as soon I have done some review.
