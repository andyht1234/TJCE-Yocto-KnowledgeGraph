Hi All,

I'm trying to get my yocto build system to get the necessary packages for
building from an internal artifactory repository instead of fetching from
online every time.

I have set up the SOURCE_MIRROR_URL="https://<artifactory>;  and got my
credentials setup under ~/.netrc. But when I run the `bitbake -c fetch foo`
for any packages I'm not able to fetch the packages from the artifactory.
The fetcher fails to parse the credentials and pass it to the artifactory
location.

Can someone help me with how to parse the netrc file of any yocto build
system?

Thanks and regards.
