What does your 'Hello World' service do? Just print 'Hello World' to the
console and then exit?

If so that would be the reason why it is inactive. Systemd starts it and
then it exits. Typically, services keep running (except for some special
cases) once they are started. That's what makes them a service. To stop
them 'systemctl stop <service>' is used. By default systemctl sends SIGTERM
to tell the service to clean up and terminate itself.

To piggyback on that, it is possible to set Type=oneshot[1] for the
service so that systemd considers the service to be up after it exited.
I find it useful for init or migration scripts that another service can
then depend upon.
