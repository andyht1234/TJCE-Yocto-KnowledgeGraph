wic images depend on the kernel device trees, and therefore should
depend on virtual/kernel:do_deploy to make sure these are present in the
deploy directory.

Most of the time, this dependency is satisfied indirectly since a rootfs
image will depend on the kernel, but add it explicitly for the cases
where it is not.

Hi Joshua,

This makes sense, and thanks for the patch. Can you push this as a PR in
GitHub? It would help us run some CI before applying it.

Thanks once again,
