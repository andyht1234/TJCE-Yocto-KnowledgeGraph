I'm building an intel-corei7-64 image using meta-intel with systemd.  I need to modify /boot/loader/loader.conf and /boot/loader/entries/boot.conf.  I've tried using devtool modify for systemd, systemd-conf, systemd-boot, and systemd-bootconf, but the files were not in those recipes.  What recipe do I modify to change loader.conf and boot.conf?

If you are using wic, you will need to modify your .wks file to supply
additional parameters as the files are generated by bootimg-efi plugin
in wic. The bootimg-efi plugin also allows supplying a custom boot cfg
file as well.

Thanks,

Is there documentation for the bootimg-efi plugin?

Thanks
