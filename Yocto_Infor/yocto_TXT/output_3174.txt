Hi,

I've been struggling to add a debian package to my build. I'm trying to
build this app and install it on the target:
https://github.com/votingworks/kiosk-browser

It's a node app built with yarn, and I've found the instructions in the
manual to be a bit off the mark for what I'm trying to do. I want to:

   1. Fetch and build the app using its own makefile
   2. Install the output debian package in the target during buildtime

My recipe is below, but as best I can tell all it does right now is package
the source directory and put it on the image. DPKG reports that it's
installed, but I can't seem to run the app. I'm sure I'm confused a bit
about the build process, and perhaps I'm not invoking a task when I should?

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

All the best,
Matt

P.S. Here's the recipe:
