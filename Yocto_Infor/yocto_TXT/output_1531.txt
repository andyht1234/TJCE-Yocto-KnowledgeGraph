Is it possible to create additional QA checks such that they apply to all
recipes automatically? Or even just to all recipes in a given layer?

I don't have a ready example, but you can start by reading
meta/classes/insane.class - I think all of the things defined in it
are extensible from a different class.

Yes, and yes.

For example, I have https://github.com/rossburton/meta-ross/blob/master/classes/insanitier.bbclass

This defines some new sanity checks, and adds them to WARN_QA so that they’re enabled and classified as warnings (use ERROR_QA if you want them to be errors).

Simply inheriting the class in your local or distro configuration with INHERIT += is enough to enable them for all recipes.
