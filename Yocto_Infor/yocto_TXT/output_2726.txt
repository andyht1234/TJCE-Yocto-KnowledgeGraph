Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.4 rc1 has been built and is heading to QA
*	Patches to master for post-release have started merging, there is a
significant queue.
*	CVEs open against master have taken a small but worrying uptick this
week.
*	There were some last minute changes to the hash equivalence server
around the algorithm used for handling the hashes to try and ensure we get
the reuse of sstate objects users would expect. These did delay the release
but we believe this was worth doing to allow best use of sstate caches.
*	There were other key changes to the task reproducibility and to the
task outhash generation which were included in the release. These should
also significantly improve hash equivalence matching and artefact reuse.
*	Intermittent issues continue to rise, some seem to be issues coming
from the newer distros we've added to the autobuilder (Centos 8 stream,
Fedora 34 and Debian 11). Help is very much welcome on these issues. You can
see the list of failures we're continuing to see by searching for the
"AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
