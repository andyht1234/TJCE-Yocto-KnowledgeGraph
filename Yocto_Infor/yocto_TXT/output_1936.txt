Add support for the EROFS image, and it's compressed options, to the
dm-verity-img.bbclass setup, theoretically this is a simple addition to
the list of types however there is a quirk in how Poky handles the
filesystems in poky/meta/classes/image_types.bbclass.

Specifically the 'IMAGE_CMD' and 'IMAGE_FSTYPES' use a hyphen, e.g.
erofs-lz4, however in the image_type bbclass the task for that would be
"do_image_erofs_lz4", replacing the hyphen with an underscore.

As the dm-verity-img.bbclass adds a dependency to the wic image creation
on the do_image_* task then it fails as there is no
"do_image_erofs-lz4", so simply replace the hypen with an underscore.
