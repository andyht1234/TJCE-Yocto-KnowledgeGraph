I want to verify whether the speaker function on the i.MX6 DL board is normal.
The HDMI connector has a hot_plug to detect whether the HDMI cable is plugged in,
Is there any way to switch to the speaker to play sound when testing with IMX player under the GUI interface?

However, there is no problem playing wav format music with aplay under the command line.
