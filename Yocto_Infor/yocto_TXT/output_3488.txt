  related to something that richard purdie mentioned on the OE list,
if one wanted to do a YP-wide "cleanup" of some indeterminate form,
what are the layers that would be considered mandatory to cover in
such a cleanup?

  no-brainers would, of course, include:

  * oe-core
  * meta-openembedded

beyond that, what else? i would think:

  * meta-virtualization
  * meta-java
  * meta-security
  * ... more? ...

and there are the vendor layers:

  * meta-intel
  * meta-freescale
  * meta-qcom
  * meta-boundary

where can one stop?

I don't have an context in the email you are referring to. Can you
include it please?
Supported will mean different things to different people.

  granted, that Q was a bit vague ... based on a suggestion of
richard's, i was going to do an "audit" of OE/YP layers to see the
effect of doing a particular minor cleanup, but it's not clear the
requirement for wide-sweepingness that would represent a sufficient
audit.

  would that necessarily cover every single layer identified at
layers.openembedded.org? that seems a bit onerous. so is there some
moderately vague definition of what constitutes a minimally
representative collection of layers?
