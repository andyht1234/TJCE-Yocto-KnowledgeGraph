I am generating eSDK for my image which includes meta-qt layer for graphics.
meta-qt uses python3 where as my meta layer uses python2
my meta layer uses python2-mako where as meta-qt layer uses python3-mako.
While generating eSDK both meta layers tries to install mako-render in /usr/bin which generate build error for eSDK generation.
Any suggestion how to resolve this issue.
