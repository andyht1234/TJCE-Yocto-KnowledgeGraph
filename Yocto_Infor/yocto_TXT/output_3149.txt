Hello there,
I am building a sysvinit recipe for a startup app. And add into the image using custom package groups. Both the package group and recipe when built on their own, the build succeeds. But, when building the image, I got error in do_rootfs task.
Here is the error msg:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
packagegroup-custom-apps : Depends: demoappstartup but it is not installable
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages. Here is the Sysvinit recipe:
SUMMARY = "startup_script"
DESCRIPTION = "This recipe builds startup applications"
LICENSE = "MIT"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"

SRC_URI = "file://demoapp_startup.sh"

INITSCRIPT_NAME = "demoapp_startup.sh"
INITSCRIPT_PARAMS = "start 99 5 2 . stop 20 0 1 6 ."

inherit update-rc.d
S = "${WORKDIR}"

do_install () {
install -d ${D}${sysconfdir}/init.d/
install -c -m 755 ${WORKDIR}/${INITSCRIPT_NAME} ${D}${sysconfdir}/init.d/${INITSCRIPT_NAME}
}
Here is the shell script for the app, demoapp_startup.sh:
#! /bin/sh
# /etc/init.d/start_sample_app
#

# Carry out specific functions when asked to by the system
case "$1" in
start)
echo "Starting sampleApp "
exec /opt/trial1/bin/trial1 -s &
;;
stop)
echo "Stopping sampleApp"
start-stop-daemon --stop --name trial1 --quiet
;;
(*))
echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/start_sample_app {start|stop}"
exit 1
;;
esac
exit 0
