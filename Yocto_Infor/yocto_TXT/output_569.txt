Hi.. community

Hope all are doing well

I'm dealing with the Yocto hardknott with my Ubuntu host

The Ubuntu version is Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS

During the building of the custom image, everything goes well until the build process hits the below error message

| make  -f CMakeFiles/Makefile2 preinstall

| make[1]: Entering directory '/home/aio/AIO_Systems_Yocto/var-fslc-yocto/build_aio/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cmake-native/3.19.5-r0/build'

| make[1]: Nothing to be done for 'preinstall'.

| make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/aio/AIO_Systems_Yocto/var-fslc-yocto/build_aio/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cmake-native/3.19.5-r0/build'

| ERROR: oe_runmake failed

for instance, I have also verified the installed version of the GLIBC via the below command

strings /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 | grep GLIBCXX

From where I got to know that, it's already installed!

Can anyone help me here to resolve the issue?

All comments and suggestions welcome

Thanks
Mahendra

22.04 is too new for hardknott which was EOL'ed a year ago. Always
check the tested distributions sections in manual for a given release.
In your case

https://github.com/yoctoproject/poky/blob/hardknott/documentation/ref-manual/system-requirements.rst#supported-linux-distributions

Upgrading uninative to a version from master will probably help fix
that. As Khem mentions, hardknott is know longer supported through.

Cheers,

I've had success building yocto hardknott images using the
crops/poky:ubuntu-20.04 docker image.
