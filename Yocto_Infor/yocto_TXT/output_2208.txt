Hello all,

I'm not sure if this is even possible at all. I'm using the meta-raspberry
layer to build raspberry images. Whilst I'm able to build images by
strictly selecting a raspberry pi machine configuration
(MACHINE=raspberrypi3), I would like to know if it's possible to build an
image that is compatible with multiple raspberry pi machine configurations.
For instance an image that would work for both raspberrypi3 and
raspberrypi4.

Thanks.
Alex

I think you can share maximum by using same tunes perhaps for pi3 and
pi4 machines but we do not generate single images which will work
across multiple SOCs.
