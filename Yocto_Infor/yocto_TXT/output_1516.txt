Good Afternoon,

I am updating a project from Honister to Kirkstone, Has anyone else run into an issue with python files with a *#!/usr/bin/python* header throwing the (abbreviated) Error below?

This did not occur with the prior honister branch, changing to *#!/usr/bin/python3 or removing the line altogether seems to resolve the issue.* I would prefer to not have to expend the time and effort involved as the same codebase is used on a legacy platforms that do not use python3.

ERROR: do_package_qa: QA Issue: /sample.py contained in package requires /usr/bin/python, but no providers found in RDEPENDS?

Thanks,

Bruce
