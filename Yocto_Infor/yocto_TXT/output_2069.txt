Hi all,

I can netboot my Raspberry Pi 4 still fine, but when I flash the image onto a usb drive using wic, booting fails. I just stops to boot at one point. I'd be glad if someone could tell me where it's hanging so I could try to start tracking it down at the right place. All metalayers are on dunfell but not at the newest commit.

USB booting was working fine months ago and I don't really know at which point it stopped working.

This is the last I get from the serial console:

    Read config.txt bytes    36302 hnd 0x00000035 
    Read start4.elf bytes  2229120 hnd 0x000025f8 
    Read fixup4.dat bytes     5448 hnd 0x0000004b

    Starting start4.elf @ 0xfeb00200 partition 0
    Stopping network
    Stop display

The rest sadly appears on the screen only, so here is an actual screenshot:

It seems to detect the usb drive just fine. The last related log line I get is

    sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk

Whatever is running (the kernel?) is not dead, though. Around 30 seconds later it prints a "vcc-sd: disabling" and some minutes later a "random: crng init done" (= random number generator is initialized).

Does anyone have an idea? I'll try to get my hands on an sd card in the meantime.

Regards,
Manuel
