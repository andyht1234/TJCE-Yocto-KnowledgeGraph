The usual approach is to build inside a defined container, like pyrex
or CROPS, for example.

Hello ,

we are using the warrior branch for our embedded Linux project. Since Ubuntu 20.04 LTS has been released we would like to switch from 18.04 to 20.04. However, Ubuntu 20.04 now uses glibc-2.31 where the stime function has been replaced. Therefore the build process of qmu-native-3.1.1.1 fails with the following error code:

/opt/ti/tq-yocto/build/tmp/hosttools/ld.bfd: linux-user/syscall.o: in function `do_syscall1': | /opt/ti/tq-yocto/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/qemu-native/3.1.1.1-r0/qemu-3.1.1.1/linux-user/syscall.c:7404: undefined reference to `stime'

Is there a work around?

Thanks a lot for your help,
Bernd
