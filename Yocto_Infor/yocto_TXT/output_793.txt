Hi guys,
I am trying to add nodejs and npm to my image file but get the below error
message.

ERROR: core-image-minimal-1.0-r0 do_image_cpio: The initramfs size
256914(K) exceeds INITRAMFS_MAXSIZE: 131072(K)
ERROR: core-image-minimal-1.0-r0 do_image_cpio: You can set
INITRAMFS_MAXSIZE a larger value. Usually, it should
ERROR: core-image-minimal-1.0-r0 do_image_cpio: be less than 1/2 of ram
size, or you may fail to boot it.

ERROR: Logfile of failure stored in:
/home/mohan/amlogic/build/tmp/work/mesons4_lib32_ap222-poky-linux/core-image-minimal/1.0-r0/temp/log.do_image_cpio.106257
ERROR: Task

I am new to yocto and am not able to solve this issue. Can you guys please
help.

Thanks and regards,
Hassan
