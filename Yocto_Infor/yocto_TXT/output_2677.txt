From: Trevor Gamblin <trevor.gamblin@windriver.com>

Add "-l 52" to PARALLEL_MAKE in config.json to limit Make and Ninja
builds based on the detected system load. With this option added, if
either tool has at least one job running and detects that the system
load exceeds the given value, it will wait until either the system load
average drops below that limit, or until all other jobs are finished
before starting additional jobs.

Since most autobuilder machines have 56 cores, this should help keep the
system from being overloaded during builds.

We have seen a lot of hung builds when we used this option internally on 
builders, Additionally some packages like bison started to fail 
intermittently which seemed like a parallel build issue but never got to 
see why it would happen only with -l enabled.

So this change would need some testing before we make it permanent into AB

Which branch did you test this with?  I had some issues when I
originally added it to dunfell but after the last patch series I am
getting green a-full and meta-oe builds on the autobuilder.

And master has been running with this for q

Accidentally hit send :-)

I intended to say that master has been running with this for quite
some time now.

In that case you might want to try again with the current dunfell
head.  It was a couple of weeks of pain, but I think I've eliminated
all of the issues with using this patch.
