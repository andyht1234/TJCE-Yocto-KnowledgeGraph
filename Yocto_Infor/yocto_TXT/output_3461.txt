Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.2.4 is in QA and will be the final release in the 3.2 series.
*	We're continuing to merge significant changes into master as patches
are tested and reviewed. This included many version upgrades(thanks Alex)
bringing us back up to date after the pause during stabilization.
*	The multiconfig changes in bitbake continue to cause problems, we
could do with simpler test cases to reproduce issues rather than huge
builds.
*	There is an effort underway to triage the remaining reported CVEs
against master and improve our presentation with regard to CVE tracking.
*	We have patches in review to enable SMP for qemu for arm and x86
machines
*	We also have a proposal to change the default x86 QEMU emulation
configuration to something more recent/modern
*	We appear to have serial IRQ handling issues with qemuppc and would
welcome help from anyone with knowledge in that area.
*	We have switched some gnome components from gtk-doc to gi-docgen in
line with upstream
*	Several of the PRServ rework patches have now merged (thanks Paul).
*	Intermittent autobuilder issues continue to occur and are now at a
record high level. You  can see the list of failures we're continuing to see
by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We are working to identify the load pattern on the infrastructure that seems
to trigger these.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
