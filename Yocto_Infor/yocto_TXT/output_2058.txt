Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.1.15 is due to be released
*	YP 3.4.3 is due to build
*	We decided to merge in a number of python recipes which allow us to
build the sphinx documentation. These are used by our documentation build
process and many of the dependencies were things which likely should have
been in core anyway.
*	There was a small performance tweak to bitbake's codeparser cache
code which seems to show around a 10% parsing speed improvement
*	We have continued to take other minimal impact upgrades and this is
having a positive impact on CVE numbers. We are looking likely to take the
recently released libtool 2.4.7 since this is similar to 2.4.6 but keeps us
current with upstream. Some recipes may need to clear out stale libtool m4
macros if version mismatch errors are seen.
*	Toaster has seen further fixes and should be ready for release.
*	The AVAILABLE_LICENSES variable was removed since it has parsing
overhead, had bad implications for task hashes and is no longer needed by
any of the core code.
*	Some changes are being proposed to the documentation build process
which should make version handling in releases easier and less error prone.
*	If people see intermittent issues in their own builds, particularly
if they're the same as intermittent issues seen on the autobuilder, please
do comment in the bugs mentioning when they happen as the frequency
information does help us prioritize fixing the most common issues.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at record high levels and help is
very much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:

ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
