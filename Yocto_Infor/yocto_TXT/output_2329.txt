Hi,

Has anyone successfully built a Linux image by Honister to run WiFi
driver, connman and wpa_supplicant for WiFi interface?

I could build an image by Zeus to run WiFi driver, wpa_supplicant,
connman and dbus well, but after upgrading to Honister, the Linux
image building was fie, but the WiFi is now broken, the WiFi failed to
respond DHCP the WiFi could not connect to Internet, something is
broken between wpa_supplicant and connman which setting kernel WiFi
driver, WiFi interface and connection. I don't see any issues in
kernel WiFi driver, connman and wpa_supplicant, something missing in
the Linux image failing to set up the WiF network interface.

Appreciate your comments.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

- jupiter

Yes, I have, but with Network Manager instead of connman. WiFi works
just fine.

There are a lot of pieces in the chain and it is not obvious from your
description where it is broken.

If you run ifconfig -a does your WiFi interface show up? If not there is an
issue with the driver. Use dmesg and filter for the driver. Often a driver
cannot load the firmware. What is your WiFi hardware?

Did you install the regulatory database?

What error messages are you seeing when attempting to connect to a WiFi
network? Did you look at the connman logs?

Hi Rudolf,

Thanks for your response and comments.

Not that bad, the WiFi interfaces was fine, but it could not get dhcp
response and IP address so an automatic private IP address 169.254 was
assigned

mlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr D4:CA:6E:A4:E8:B4
          inet addr:169.254.193.101  Bcast:169.254.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0

          RX bytes:330 (330.0 B)  TX bytes:16392 (16.0 KiB)

I could see WiFi information well, it is not a major problem, but the
subtle issues are connman and wpa_supplicant did not set up the WiFi
driver correctly.

Did you mean to enable CONFIG_CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB? No, I did not
install it in the Zeus version either so I don't see that could be an
issue.

No error in connman, I don't think it is connman or wpa_supplicant
issue, my suspicion is something missing in Honister built image to
prevent connman and wpa_supplicant to set up the WiFi driver
correctly.

It is not the first time I have the WiFi setup trouble to get WiFi
169.254 address, when I upgraded from Thud to Zeus, I got the exactly
the same problem that WiFi was assigned by a 169.254 address, no dhcp
response, at time, I was totally convinced it was connman issue, I
spend several months to debug connman and wpa_supplicant without any
results, then after waiting several months to pull updated Zeus again,
that problem was disappeared miraculous, that is why I suspect the
same problem in oe-core and bitbake in Honister as well.

Are there anyone in oe-core and bitbake tested connman, wpa_supplicant
for the current Honister branch? I can help to test and to debug it if
more advanced people in oe-core, bitbake, kernel, WiFi driver mwifiex
can provide me more information.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

Hi JH,

Are you using custom Linux kernel / custom device tree? Maybe there is
some issue there?

Hi Tomasz,

Thanks for your response.

> Are you using custom Linux kernel / custom device tree? Maybe there is

Yes, but the Zeus build image uses the same device tree that could run
WiFi connection without any issues, I am comparing the same source and
configuration between Zeus and Honister, the only difference is the
two different OE Yocto versions.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

This would typically mean that you are actually connected to a wifi 
network but the interface did not receive a DHCP lease for the IP 
address. the 169.254. is local IPv4 IP address which the interface would 
typically get if the DHCP client times out.

I don't think that this is a wpa_supplicant issue. However, you can use 
connmanctl to manually connect to a wifi network:

$ connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
San completed for wifi
connmanctl> services
[service list follows]
connmanctl> agent on
Agent registered
connmanctl> connect wifi_xxxxxx
Agent RequestInput wifi_xxxxx
    Passphrase = [ Type=psk, Requirement=mandatory ]
Passphrase? ********
Connected wifi_xxxxxx
conmanctl> quit

If that works the wifi authentication is OK.

Only a wag on my side. Should be ok since the wifi driver is working.

Well, ok then it looks like a dhcp issue. Did you attempt to set a 
static IP to test connectivity?

Eventually it could be a router issue. Maybe the router blocks unknown 
devices?

Honestly, I don't think the issue is related to connman or 
wpa_supplicant at all but on the dhcp level.
