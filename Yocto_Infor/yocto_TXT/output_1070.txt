Hi all.

I'm working on a board with kirkstone.

I update every layers with latest kirkstone branch available, poky layer 
too.


I'm patching the kernel 6.0.8 for debug purpose: 0001-debug.patch

I make a patch with quilt as I do in the past (before update of poky)

The problem is this:

- I do "bitbake -c devshell virtual/kernel" and I get the terminal 
prompt on kernel-source folder: i check and the patch is applied

- I do "quilt top" and quilt tell me "No series file found"


Where is my patch?


Best regards,

 Â  MZ

Is the kernel using git to handle patches instead of quilt?

Cheers,

Richard

I try to look for PATCHTOOL variable for virtual/kernel recipe and the 
variable is set to quilt.

But inside log.do_patch I see that task try to use 'git am'


I wa use to patch the kernel with

1. bitbake -c devshell virtual/kernel

2. quilt new patchfile.patch

3. quilt add source.c

4. edit source.c

5. quilt refresh

6. copy patchfile.patch inside the recipe FILEEXTRAPATHS folder


Now I'm trying with devtool
