Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.1.12 is due for release this week
*	YP 3.4.1 is going into QA.
*	Next week is the first milestone build for 3.5.
*	There are some major changes with python modules to be able to
support 5.16 and later kernels due to new dependencies
*	We continue to see a reduction in the number of patches in "Pending"
state. Many thanks to everyone who has taken the time to review patch status
and handle accordingly, particularly where they were accepted upstream. This
will significantly benefit the project in the long term.
*	Intermittent issues continue to rise and help is very much welcome
on these issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to see by
searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.5_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.

Patches in the Pending State: 412 (32%) [last week 422 (33%)]

I went ahead and made a list of top 10 'owners of pending patches'. I have
to stress that this is absolutely not a 'wall of shame' or anything
negative: these patches are in itself significant work, and sending patches
upstream - and crucially, rebasing, fixing CI fails and following up on
upstream feedback - is a significant effort on top, and when yocto project
itself needs to move forward and company management is asking to deliver a
product at the same time, the time for upstreaming may simply not be there.
So  please keep these numbers in mind and try to avoid making them bigger.

109 Khem Raj
29 Richard Purdie
24 Alexander Kanavin
15 unknown
15 Ross Burton
15 Robert Yang
11 Hongxu Jia
10 Martin Jansa
8 Joe Slater
8 Chen Qi

Another interesting statistic is that of 108 people with pending patches,
80 own only one or two patches.
