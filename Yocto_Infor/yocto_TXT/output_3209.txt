I am running with zeus 3.0.4 and appear to have an issue with the mount command supporting NFS... ?

Can someone explain the following and how I can get "mount" to support NFS ?

Trying to mount the UDM from the AIO
mount.nfs: Operation not permitted
Failed to mount the UDM from the AIO!
Trying tNFS: bad mount option value specified: minorversion=1

Thanks,
Steve
