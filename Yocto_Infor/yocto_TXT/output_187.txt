Hello all,

While building the yocto project distribution using our custom layer 
'meta-atmel', we are getting this below error:

ERROR: libplanes-1.0.3+gitAUTOINC+d897de598d-r0 do_package_qa: QA 
Issue:libplanes rdepends on libdrm-dev [dev-deps]
ERROR: libegt-1.7-r0 do_package_qa: QA Issue: libegt rdepends on 
cairo-dev [dev-deps]

The recipe for libplanes is at

https://github.com/linux4sam/meta-atmel/blob/kirkstone/recipes-graphics/libplanes/libplanes_1.0.3.bb

and the recipe for libegt is at

https://github.com/linux4sam/meta-atmel/blob/kirkstone/recipes-graphics/libegt/libegt_1.7.bb

We tried adding libdrm to RDEPENDS of libplanes recipe but "Nothing 
provides libdrm-dev" error was thrown. Any idea what's wrong here ?

Regards,
Hari
