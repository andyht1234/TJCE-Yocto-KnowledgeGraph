Hi there

I am new to Yocto and I am still struggling to build the SDK - I am on
the master branch, after I had different problems with missing
dependencies and configure failures in mickledore I went to master.
Here I can successfully build core-image-full-cmdline without problems.
Everything is fine. Now when it comes the populate_sdk I always get the
following error:


package target-sdk-provides-dummy-1.0-r0.sdk_provides_dummy_target is intended for a different architecture

It says that the architecture for the target-sdk-provides-dummy is «sdk_provides_dummy_target»:
