Hello,

I would like to write a .bbappend for config.txt, cmdline.txt and /etc/inittab in my custom layer to make some changes.

The recipe append for config.txt is created like this:
FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "$(THISDIR)/files:"
SRC_URI += "file://rpi-config.patch"

The paths of the recipe and patch are in the custom layer's bblayer.conf.
But Bitbake doesn't search the custom layer for the recipe append.

Is it a proper way to do that? If yes, what might be missing in the configuration?

Thanks!
Crane

yes, however, which recipe are you referring to?

Thanks Raj for your quick reply.

For config.txt, the recipe I am referring to is rpi-config_git.bb in meta-respberrypi layer. This is the one I am testing now.

Further on, I will add recipe appends for rpi-cmdline.bb.
To change /etc/inittab, I still need to find which recipe to append.

Thanks!
Crane

what is the name you are using for bbappend ? secondly what does your
layer.conf look like for this custom layer ?

The recipe append name I used is rpi-config_git.bbappend.
It is placed in meta-custom/recipes-bsp/bootfiles/

The layer conf of the custom layer is like this:
# We have a conf and classes directory, add to BBPATH
BBPATH .= ":${LAYERDIR}"
# We have recipes-* directories, add to BBFILES
BBFILES += "${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb \
${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bbappend"
BBFILE_COLLECTIONS += "meta-farview"
BBFILE_PATTERN_meta-farview = "^${LAYERDIR}/"
BBFILE_PRIORITY_meta-farview = "19"
LAYERDEPENDS_meta-farview = "core"
LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_meta-farview = "kirkstone"

this looks good. So now what kind of error do you see. You might want
to check the build tree of this recipe and see if the patch is applied
in S

The error is this when bitbaking only the recipe for rpi-config:
"WARNING: rpi-config-git-r5 do_fetch: Failed to fetch URL file://0001-disable-bluetooth-and-enable-uart0.patch, attempting MIRRORS if available
ERROR: rpi-config-git-r5 do_fetch: Fetcher failure: Unable to find file file://0001-disable-bluetooth-and-enable-uart0.patch anywhere. The paths that were searched were:
....
"
The listed searching paths don't include the custom layer where the patch is placed.
The complete error info is in the attached file "bitbake rpi-config.txt".

When bitbaking the recipe for the image, the error is the same.
The complete error info is in attached file "bitbake image.txt".

where does 0001-disable-bluetooth-and-enable-uart0.patch exist in your
layer? can you show the path ?

Hi, it might be a syntax issue with THISDIR variable expansion: it should
be in curly braces for Yocto.

FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/files:"
SRC_URI:append =  " file://rpi-config.patch"

Have a look to this Variable Expansion documentation for more details:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/bitbake/2.2/bitbake-user-manual/bitbake-user-manual-metadata.html#variable-expansion

Regards,
Daniel

Thanks Daniel for your input.

Yes I tried and it works to find the patch now. It should be in curly braces.

I am wondering why it couldn't be identified by checking the environment FILESEXTRAPATHS. Not matter round braces or curly braces are used, the value of this variable keeps the same as below:
crane@Ubuntu2204:~/yocto-pi/build$ bitbake -e farview-image-base | grep ^FILESEXTRAPATHS=
FILESEXTRAPATHS="__default:"

crane@Ubuntu2204:~/yocto-pi/build$ bitbake -e farview-image-base | grep ^FILESEXTRAPATHS=
FILESEXTRAPATHS="__default:"

crane@Ubuntu2204:~/yocto-pi/build$

Ah yes I was ignoring it all along thinking it is meta code but if it is
literally coded like this then that is the issue really

Thanks Raj!

I forgot where I copied this piece of code. I just copied and didn't check and believed it.
This is the problem!

Now the issue is with the patch itself.

The patch is created by using "diff -ruN" is not working. The error is "no file to patch". I can understand this as the file compared to in the patch doesn't exist in the $(WORKDIR).

I changed to use "git format-patch" in the $(WORKDIR) to generate the patch. But still not working. The error is "does not apply (enforce with -f)".

And applying -f option got the same error.

Where is the problem? The way to create the patch or apply the patch.

you should generate it w.r.t S not WORKDIR

You mean S folder?
Yes, to be specific, it is S folder. The reason I just mentioned WORKDIR was to compare with the irrelevant folder where "diff -ruN" is used to create the patch.
Or you mean something else?

Finally find the correct way to do that.
Do "bitbake -c devshell <recipe>" and then in the folder created use "git format-patch" to create the patch file.
This way, the patch can be applied.
