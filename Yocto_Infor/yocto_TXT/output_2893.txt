I have a rather simple bitbake package which adds a shared library foo.so
to the system in /usr/lib/. However, on first boot, I am always forced to
do an explicit "ldconfig" for the library to be detected by the
applications. Subsequent reboots do not need an ldconfig.

Can I avoid this ldconfig step ? As all other libraries work fine without
it.

Here is my .bb file :

DESCRIPTION = "FOO library"
DEPENDS = "bar"
LICENSE = "MIT"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://LICENSE.txt;md5=00006733ca3231dd8b07dde266d4d4e4"
FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}-${PV}:"

SRC_URI = "file://foo-1.0.tar.gz"
S = "${WORKDIR}/foo-1.0"

inherit autotools pkgconfig

BBCLASSEXTEND = "native nativesdk"
EXTRA_OEMAKE = '-C ${S} FOO_BITBAKE=yes'
FILES_${PN} += "/usr/lib/*.so"

do_compile() {
    oe_runmake
}

do_install()
    oe_runmake DESTDIR=${D} install
}

Thanks for your help!
Ash
