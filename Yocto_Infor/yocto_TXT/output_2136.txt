its not going to be backward ABI compatible with honister due to variable renaming.

Hi,

can you please create honister branch.

I think 17703ee37b46d15ec369588fbb86dde336df6028 commit (just before this
kirkstone change was applied) would be reasonable branching point.

Now there isn't any branch compatible with Honister release.

Thanks
