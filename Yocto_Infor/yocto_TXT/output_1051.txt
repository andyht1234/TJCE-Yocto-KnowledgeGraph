When creating recipes for Rust projects, all of the required crates are included in SRC_URI. I need to patch the source of several crates. I've tried creating individual recipes, but that does not really help.

I've managed to get a hacky fix to work, however it involves having recipes copy source from the tmp/work directory, which is not ideal. It patches the Cargo.toml to replace the version of the dependency with a local path to expect the sources in.

Is there a good way to do the patches necessary within bitbake, or should I be creating my own forks of all these packages?

If you're just patching in later versions of the crates, this should work:

SRC_URI += "crate://crates.io/<target>/<version>"
EXTRA_OECARGO_PATHS = "${CARGO_VENDORING_DIRECTORY}/<target>-<version>"

or if you have them patched in a git repo:

SRC_URI += "git://.../<target>"
EXTRA_OECARGO_PATHS = "${WORKDIR}/<target>"

Only works if they're already in crates.io though
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html)
and you'll probably run into
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/98185

I suspect we really need some standard machinery here.
