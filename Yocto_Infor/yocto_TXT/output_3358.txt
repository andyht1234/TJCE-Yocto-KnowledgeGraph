Hello,

I'm trying to add a custom `xorg.conf` file to my yocto build, by 
defining a 
`recipes-graphics/xorg-xserver/xserver-xf86-config_0.1.bbappend` recipe 
to my layer.

However, it seems like I always end up getting the (empty) `xorg.conf` 
file from 
`meta-yocto-bsp/recipes-graphics/xorg-xserver/xserver-xf86-config_0.1.bbappend`, 
even though poky's `meta-yocto-bsp` layer has lower priority (5) than my 
own (6).
I do get my own `xorg.conf` file if I remove (or rename) the 
meta-yocto-bsp recipe, so this really looks like a precedence problem.

Any idea what I may be missing ?

Thanks !

Stefan

A common mistake would be the forgotten semi-colon and/or _prepend:
FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/files"

Another common mistake is to not respect the tree layout of the original
path relative to the original recipe (or for that matter, the one you
want to override coming from the bbappend) for xorg.conf.
In that case, you can see that in meta-yocto-bsp, there's a parent
directory of xorg.conf that is not the one listed in
FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend. You should add this directory in the path of
your bbappend.

slides 70 to 80 might help you. The recording should be available in a
few days/weeks.

Cheers,
Quentin

Indeed, I was basing my layout on the original recipe, not on the poky 
override (which adds the $MACHINE as a subdirectory).

With that adjustment everything appears to be working fine.

Thanks a lot, this looks really useful !
