Hi,
Iam working on dunfell and i'm trying to use fw_printenv and fw_setenv, but
i'm getting *Configuration file wrong or corrupted *message . Also the
fw_env.config file is not seen inside /etc/ folder.
I tried the commands after pasting a  fw_env.config file in /etc/ folder
but same result.

I included libubootenv in IMAGE_INSTALL variable


Is there any other configurations that need to be done . Please help on
this topic
Regards
Sethumadhav
