Hi everyone,

I'm currently trying to move from an m.2 SATA SSD to an m.2 nvme SSD for 
our project, without success.
I'm using an Intel NUC7 board that has an m.2 slot which should support 
(from the datasheet) both SATA and nvme SSD.

I'm able to see the grub menu from the nvme drive but when I try to boot 
to a partition I get stuck on a black screen.
Which makes me believe that the bios is able to access and read the nvme 
SSD (or at least the boot partition)
I can't figure out if I'm missing a driver or if I need something 
specific in our wks file to support nvme SSD

I have tested the nvme SSD with an external m.2 to USB adaptor to verify 
that it's working properly

I would like to know if there's anything I should look into.

I'm currently on warrior but I believe i had a similar issue with 
dunfell as well...
