Using TOPDIR variable breaks the sstate-cache every time build directory
changes totally breaking build from sstate-cache among different workspaces.

Changing that to TMPDIR that is included in BB_HASHEXCLUDE_COMMON.

Another thing is disabling the UNINATIVE_LOADER, causing sstate-cache
artifacts not working in different workspaces. On
populate_sysroot_setscene patchelf-uninative --set-interpreter with
empty argument is ran which does not change the interpreter path and
then bazel binary ends up with path to the interpreter that might not
exist, since the bazel was taken from sstate-cache.

Removing the UNINATIVE_LOADER = "" so that uninative.bbclass can
correctly replace the interpreter path and make bazel binary usable.
One could think that it will reintroduce the original issue behind
disabling uninative, which was some java file corrupted (see commit
dd7642b), but I think we don't have this problem anymore and also I
don't think it was the correct solution - since the loader is anyway
included in the binary, so it wasn't really disabling it, just disabling
the yocto functionality around uninative. If the error re-occurs I think
different solution should be found.

Why not use the something inside the bitbake TMPDIR, if it is temporary the
correct place will be in TMPDIR.

so TMPDIR="${TMPDIR}/bazel" looks better IMO.

Hi Jose,

I wanted to keep the same directory as it was before, but you're right
TMPDIR/bazel will be better place. I'll send second patch.

Best regards,

The default bibtake config is TMPDIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/tmp" so in this case it
will be the same directory
but note that this is not always true and the TMPDIR can be changed in some
distros configs, in this cases it will be stored somewhere else.
