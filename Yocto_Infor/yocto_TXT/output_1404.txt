Hi.. there

Hope all are doing well

I'm working with the Yocto dunfell branch with the STM32MP1
My goal is to add the test.sh script in to the rootfs of the Yocto custom image (in to the bindir)

That's how, i have created the recipes file called "recipes-support"
Inside that, i have created "net-cfg" file
the files under net-cfg file at where, i have kept test.sh file
here is the tree structure

.
└── net-cfg
├── files
│   └── test.sh
└── net-cfg_1.0.bb

I have installed the image with the custom-image.bb file as a
IMAGE_INSTALL += "net-cfg"

The content of the net-cfg_1.0.bb are as follows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY= "Script files for the testing"
SRC_URI = " file://test.sh"

LICENSE = "CLOSED"

do_install() {
install -d ${D}${bindir}
install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/test.sh ${D}${bindir} /
}

FILES_${PN} += "${bindir}/test.sh"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the baking the image, i got the error like *| install: cannot create regular file '/test.sh': Permission denied*

I have attached the full error logs here

Can any one help me here to figure out the issue ?

Thanks
Mahendra

I don't think you intended to have this space here            ^

That's why it is attempting to install test.sh to /

Spurious slash at the end of the line, it tries to install 
${WORKDIR}/test.sh and ${D}${bindir} to / (root directory of your build 
machine).

Just remove it.

Cheers,
Quentin
