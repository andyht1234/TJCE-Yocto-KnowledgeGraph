Interesting... What is the difference between variables
${KERNEL_IMAGETYPES} and ${KERNEL_IMAGETYPE_FOR_MAKE} ?

In my setup I have:

* KERNEL_IMAGETYPES=fitImage (coming from KERNEL_IMAGETYPE of my machine configuration) 
* KERNEL_IMAGETYPE_FOR_MAKE=Image (used only internally by kernel.bbclass and setting to Image because of [this line](https://github.com/openembedded/openembedded-core/blob/dunfell/meta/classes/kernel-fitimage.bbclass#L29)
