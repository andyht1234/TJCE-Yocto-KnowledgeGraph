Hello,

the python3-smbus package no longer builds.

The install step ends with the following error message:
ERROR: python3_smbus-4.3-*.whl is not a valid wheel filename.

Does anyone have an idea what is the cause?

Many greetings,
Matthias

Hi Matthias,

this is cause by merged PEP-517 changes.
To make it build again just inject

PIP_INSTALL_PACKAGE = "smbus"

into the recipe or a bbappend.
Mainly the python3-prefix of the recipe, makes the name guessing fail, I 
suspect patches to be incoming soon

Hello Konrad,

Thanks for the quick feedback.

Have you been able to build the package with the change?
I get a similar error with it:

ERROR: smbus-4.3-*.whl is not a valid wheel filename.

Best reagrds,
Matthias

Try

PYPA_WHEEL = "${PIP_INSTALL_DIST_PATH}/smbus-*-*.whl"

instead - and it should really work

Hello Konrad,

unfortunately it still does not build:

ERROR: smbus-*-*.whl is not a valid wheel filename.

Best regards,
Matthias

Hi Matthias,

you're right :(

PYPA_WHEEL = "${S}/py-smbus/dist/smbus-*-*.whl"

finally does it

@Tim @Richard
PYPA_WHEEL doesn't respect SETUPTOOLS_SETUP_PATH, which might be another 
issue to fix

Hello Konrad,

Thank you very much!

The package is now building.
I have sent a corresponding patch.

Many greetings,
