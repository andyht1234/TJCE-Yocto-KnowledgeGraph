these are some config files for doing what ? from what it looks like,
this inc file is adding a kernel config fragment
if so then it should be appended too kernel recipe so if
aiox-swdebugfs.bb is kernel recipe then you are doing it
right, but then you might have to look into this kernel recipe and
ensure that it has enabled merging configs feature
from kernel. Otherwise these cfgs wont be processed.

When you say:

" you might have to look into this kernel recipe and ensure that it has enabled merging configs feature from kernel"

Are you talking about inheriting from "kernel-yocto" in order to work with configuration fragments ?

Thanks,
Steve

if you are using linux-yocto for kernel then it is surely supported ,
so as long as it is added to kernel recipe it should work ok.
