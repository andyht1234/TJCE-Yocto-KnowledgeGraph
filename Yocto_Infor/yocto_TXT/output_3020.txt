Hi,

I upgrade Zeus to Hardknott, the kernel version is 5.10.4
(oe-user@oe-host) (arm-oe-linux-gnueabi-gcc (GCC) 10.2.0, GNU ld (GNU
Binutils) 2.36.1.20210209), it was failed to boot the kernel :

---------------

[    9.418302] systemd[1]: Failed to mount tmpfs at /sys/fs/cgroup: No
such file or directory
[    9.431805] systemd[1]: Failed to mount cgroup at
/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd: No such file or directory
[!!!!!!] Failed to mount API filesystems.
[    9.463151] systemd[1]: Freezing execution.

What could I be missing?

Thank you.

Kind regards,

- jh

You are using systemd with the wrong defconfig setup, my best guess.

cgroup option in the config must be set to Y while using systemd:
CONFIG_CGROUP=Y .

Look at kernel kconfig options that should be enabled here
