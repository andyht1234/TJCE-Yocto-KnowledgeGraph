Hello list,
I'm getting the following error message:
do_package_write_ipk: An allarch packagegroup shouldn't depend on packages which are dynamically renamed (zint to libzint2.11)

The zint_2.11.0.bb recipe is below:

# Recipe created by recipetool
# This is the basis of a recipe and may need further editing in order to be fully functional.
# (Feel free to remove these comments when editing.)

SUMMARY = "A barcode generator and library"
# WARNING: the following LICENSE and LIC_FILES_CHKSUM values are best guesses - it is
# your responsibility to verify that the values are complete and correct.

FILES:${PN} = "/usr/lib/lib*.so* /usr/include/*.h"

INSANE_SKIP:${PN} += "dev-so"


The recipe doesn't contain anything that indicates that it is 'dynamically' renaming anything.

Can anybody tell help me understand what is going on and what I need to do to get past this?

This has popped up in the process of going from hardknot to kirkstone.

Regards,
Greg

Hello list,
I changed the license on the recipe below to 'GPL-3.0-or-later' and the problem went away.

Can anyone explain what is going on? I don't understand how the package name was being changed in the first place, and I certainly don't understand why changing the license should change that behavior.

Regards,
Greg

It keeps getting weirder and weirder, I ran -c cleansstate and rebuilt the sdk and I didn't get an error. I then added something else into the sdk build and now I get the 'dynamically renamed' error for zint.
