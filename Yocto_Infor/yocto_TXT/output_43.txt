  given that other acrhitectures have their own ML, is it reasonable
that risc-v have its own mailing list?

We do not have generic architecture specific layers, existing mailing
lists should suffice for that matter.
I think you are referring to BSP layer specific mailing list they also
happen to main proponents of architecture,
these are member maintained layers.

meta-arm, meta-intel etc are primarily because they take patches via the mailing list.

meta-riscv (https://github.com/riscv/meta-riscv) does pull requests and issues via GitHub.  If the yocto@ list ended up getting swamped with riscv-specific discussion then there’s be a case for creating a list, but architecture-specific discussion is rare.
