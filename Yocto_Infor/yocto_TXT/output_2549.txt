I'm a bit torn on this. They are no longer officially supported releases now but
it may make sense to rebuild all the sphinx docs in this script rather than some
subset?

Cheers,

Richard

I understand. Your decision to make.
I just proposed this change for consistency with the current implementation.

Any other opinions?

Cheers
Michael.

Thanks for casting your vote. It makes sense. I'll send another patch
with this decision in the comments.

I agree with Quentin here. Until we have a better mechanism (to rebuild
only modified branches not all of them each time, ..) I think we should
continue to build them all.
