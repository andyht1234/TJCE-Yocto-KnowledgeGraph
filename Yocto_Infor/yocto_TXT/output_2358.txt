Michael,

I noticed that the
https://www.yoctoproject.org/reproducible-build-results/ website went
down (it always shows "Error fetching test results"). I did a little
debugging and I think that the CORS setting on git.yoctoproject.org is
not allowing www.yoctoproject.org to request the data anymore. I
thought we had fixed this at one point in the past and maybe it got
lost somewhere along the way?

If that's something we can fix, that would be great, otherwise we
might need to look into another solution for fetching the
reproducibility data.

Thanks,
Joshua Watt
