Hello everyone,

I'm having an issue with a postinstall scriptlet failing for a package
that I am trying to add to my Yocto image. Initially I had a simple
CMake C++ application that installs itself (a single binary file), a
systemd service and a d-bus interface file. This was causing no issues.
Lets call this application A. Then I wanted to create a second
application based on this, so I copied everything from application A to
application B, replacing the name A with B everywhere. When I try to add
this second application B to my image I get this error:

ERROR: do_rootfs: Postinstall scriptlets of ['B'] have failed. If the
intention is to defer them to first boot,
then please place them into pkg_postinst_ontarget_${PN} ().
Deferring to first boot via 'exit 1' is no longer supported.

By looking at the postinstall scriptlet (which I suppose comes from
inheriting the systemd class) I assume that the command:
systemctl ${OPTS} enable "$service"
for some reason fails.

I thought I had missed replacing the name A with B somewhere, but the in
the postinst script the correct name (B) is used.

Any ideas? I do not know where to continue troubleshooting from here. Is
it possible to "debug" the postinstall scriptlet in the environment that
it is running in?

It's a shell script. You can add pwd, ls, echo commands, and
whatever else you would do during debugging. set -x comes to my
my mind although I don't remember having done that. I see no
reason why it would not work. Whether there is a way to do it
more interactively I don't know.

The output will be in the log file, I'd assume (although I have
not had to debug any scriptlet recently). You could also use
output redirection.

I tried adding some echo commands to the postinst template in
systemd.bbclass, but all that produced was some really weird build
errors. As far as I could figure out bitbake calls okpg which in turn
calls the post-install scriptlet, and bitbake then parses the output
(looking at the bitbake code it doesn't look like outputting some
arbitrary text would make it fail, but I'm no expert).

One interesting discovery from the build log when comparing to the
working application shows that the working application creates a link to
the systemd service, while the non-working application does not:

Installing B on root
Downloading file:[...]/B.ipk.
Configuring B.
B.postinst returned 1, marking as unpacked only, configuration required
on target.
WARNING: B.postinst returned 1, marking as unpacked only, configuration
required on target.

Installing A on root
Downloading file:[..]/A.ipk.
ln -s /lib/systemd/system/A.service
[..]/rootfs/etc/systemd/system/gateway.target.requires/A.service
Configuring A.

I guess that the missing link is what causes

systemctl ${OPTS} enable "$service"

in the postinstall scriptlet to fail. Given that these applications have
identical bitbake recipes except for the names, I do not understand why
this is happening.

Well, this error proved not to be so mysterious after all. When copying
stuff from A to B I somehow managed to drop the initial '['-character in
the [Unit] section of application B:s .service-file so its syntax became
invalid, thus failing to be installed.
