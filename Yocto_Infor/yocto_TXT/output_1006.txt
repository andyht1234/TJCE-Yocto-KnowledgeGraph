Hello,

I asked this on the meta-amd mailing list but got no response.

Can anyone tell me what needs to be added to an image if I want to enable
accelerated video decoding and display on commodity (PC) AMD hardware?

The image is currently running Xorg and, at least on Intel hardware, is
capable of accelerated decoding and display using VAAPI and OpenGL. The
user application uses gstreamer for decoding and display.

Thanks,

Ori Pessach

I don’t have any direct experience, but a search for “Radeon” on layerindex
gives some hints:
https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/recipes/?q=Radeon

So you probably want xf86-video-amdgpu and linux-firmware-amdgpu.

Thanks.

Unfortunately, neither xf86-video-amdgpu nor linux-firmware seem to be
available. meta-amd certainly doesn't have them, and  xf86-video-amdgpu is
only in a newer branch of meta-oe than the one I'm currently using.

xf86-video-ati is available and I already use it - it doesn't accelerate
OpenGL or video decoding, unfortunately.

Regarding meta-amd, its FEATURES.md suggests that it doesn't support any
multimedia features on any of its targeted machines. I'm left wondering
what it does support...

Any other suggestions? Or ideas why the mesa recipe doesn't want to build
the radeonsi driver even though the version I'm building (21.2.4) seems to
include it?

Thanks,

Ori Pessach

You need to enable gallium-llvm and r600 PACKAGECONFIGS for mesa to 
build the radeonsi driver
