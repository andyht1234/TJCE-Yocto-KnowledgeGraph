My builds use a package feed, and the way I’ve been generating my package feed is to create a packagegroup recipe that RDEPENDS on all of the top level packages I want pulled into my feed. Then I’ll generate the packagefeed index and copy the content of tmp/deploy/ipk to the web server.

On master, only the packages from the specific recipe I built are populated into tmp/deploy/ipk, but none of the RDEPENDS. I’m using ipk, but the same behavior holds for rpm and deb.

After bisecting, I found that yes, this is now expected behavior: 
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/?id=568f62214bca3ac6d35eef8d9f4562596fb4c9ab

Basically, that commit removes the recursive dependency on the packaging tasks. Using ‘bitbake --runall build ...’ as suggested in the commit does provide the behavior I want. For me, this is only an issue when building my package feeds. It seems that the documentation for the package feeds should be updated to reflect this change. Unless I missed something, if you follow the docs you end up with a broken feed that is missing a lot of needed packages.

I can probably write something up if needed. I think just a paragraph explaining it in this section somewhere:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#using-runtime-package-management

Thanks,
Robert
