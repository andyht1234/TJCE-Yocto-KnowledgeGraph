Hello all,

I'm building an image to run on various SBCs and would like to equip it with a graphical interface.

There are quite a few things very unclear to me. Can someone help me with that?

* Why is X11 enabled by setting an IMAGE_FEATURE (namely  x11, x11-base or x11-sato), while Wayland is enabled by IMAGE_INSTALL only (weston-init and weston)? 
* Theory: Is IMAGE_FEATURE +=x11 manipulating IMAGE_INSTALL under the hood so you don't have to do it manually? And as there is no IMAGE_FEATURE "wayland", you have do it manually. Correct?
* Why is Wayland different in that it doesn't need an IMAGE_FEATURE to enable it?
* Why does core-image-weston.bb need to enable IMAGE_FEATURE hwcodec, while core-image-x11.bb does not? (Dunfell branch.)

Thank you.
Regards, Manuel

x11-* features is primarily to control what kind of x11 packages you
want to include in image e.g.
./meta/recipes-sato/packagegroups/packagegroup-core-x11-sato.bb is
pulled in when x11-sato is added to IMAGE_FEATURES
we have many X11 based images and sato is one of them so thats why its
separated out.

you should really is looking at DISTRO_FEATURES e.g. wayland distro
feature is needed for core-image-weston to build.

there are not many wayland based compositors or images we have in core
as of now.

openGL is needed for wayland/weston to work too but hwcodec feature is
infact to pull in machine specific drivers MACHINE_HWCODECS into image
if a given BSP defined it.
e.g. intel bsps define vaapi codecs and mediasdk for specific machines
via MACHINE_HWCODECS
defaults for this image features are empty

Hi Khem, thanks! will need to look into this and digest what you said.

Thanks, regards, Manuel

Okay, so if I get things right then IMAGE_FEATURES+="x11" is under the hood nothing more than an IMAGE_INSTALL+="packagegroup-core-x11". Is that right? If so, what's the purpose of adding the concept of IMAGE_FEATURE? I mean, it doesn't make things SO much easier. Setting an IMAGE_FEATURE or an IMAGE_INSTALL variable is the same to me.

Yepp, I know. I left them out on purpose because I was mainly interested in where the configuration for X11 and wayland differs conceptually. With "conceptually" I mean that one is added through IMAGE_FEATURES while the other is through IMAGE_INSTALL.

And if there would be more wayland based compositors or images then you would turn extract this into an IMAGE_FEATURE as well? Why? How does that make things easier? Again, I feel there's something to IMAGE_FEATURES I didn't yet understand.

Thanks for the explanation on MACHINE_HWCODEC. I'm curious, so is core-image-x11 require DISTRO_FEATURE hwcodec or not? If yes, than it seems to be missing in the core-image-x11.bb (it's in the core-images-weston.bb, after all), if no, then why is it not required for X11?


I know I'm asking quite detailed questions, but I got the feeling I need to understand this once and for all.

Thanks, regards, Manuel
