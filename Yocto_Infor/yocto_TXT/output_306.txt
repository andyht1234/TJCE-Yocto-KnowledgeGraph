Hello,

I am using Yocto to build a image for Raspberry Pi 3. I don't see a specific group for RaspberryPi and hope to get help from here.

I am using Kirkstone commit and didn't download meta-openembedded as it doesn't say it is needed in README. And it works to build a image.

Now I would like to add a new machine in the my customized layer to make some changes based on the original machine configuration.
So I copied raspberrypi3.conf from meta-raspberrypi to my new layer first.

But bitbake displays errors as below:

=======================================================================================================
crane@Ubuntu2204:~/yocto-pi/build$ bitbake -k farview-image-base

crane@Ubuntu2204:~/yocto-pi/build$

=====================================================================================================

I don't understand why it tries to parse core-image-testcontroller.bb, which I don't intentionally use at all.
I am afraid that the process to create a new machine is not correct.

Does anyone can help with understanding what is missing here? Or it is not the correct way to create a new machine for raspberrypi?

Thanks!
Crane

What does your new machine conf looks like ?
Generally you do something like

MACHINEOVERRIDES =. "raspberrypi3:"
include conf/machine/raspberrypi3.conf

Yes it work.
It looks simply copying the contents to the new one doesn't work.

Thanks!
