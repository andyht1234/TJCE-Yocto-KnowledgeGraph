Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.2.4 is due to build this week which would be the final release
in the 3.2 series.
*	We are pleased to announce that our April 2022 release (potentially
3.5) will be the next LTS as per our original two year schedule. If there
are features desired in the next LTS, now is the time to get them submitted
and stabilized ready.
*	Patches are now flowing into master for 3.4 for M1 which is now
undergoing active development.
*	We upgraded to gcc 11, thanks Khem for a lot of work in getting up
ready to do that!
*	A couple of key fixes for multiconfig builds were added to bitbake.
*	A new uninative version was released to address issues found in
patchelf with some native binaries, particularly when gold was used as a
linker due to differing note section alignment values.
*	Intermittent autobuilder issues continue to occur and are now at a
record high level. You  can see the list of failures we're continuing to see
by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We are working to identify the load pattern on the infrastructure that seems
to trigger these.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.

What will happen to the current LTS at that point? Will support be cut off,
will there be a transition window, or is it currently undefined?

We have discussed extending it but we currently only have the funding for the
originally planned 2 years. Discussions are continuing but since we do all 
agree that the next LTS will start then, we decided to at least let people 
plan against that.

Unless funding/support is secured, dunfell would move to community support
if anyone were willing to step up, or become EOL and replaced by the new LTS.
There would likely be some period of overlap of a few months to transition.

There is also concern about pressuring wider community layers for longer support
cycles which is something we need to think about.

Cheers,

Richard
