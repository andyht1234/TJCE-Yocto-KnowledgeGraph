Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.1 was released.
*	Fixes for issues mentioned in the 4.1 release notes have merged to
the langdale branch (thanks Ross).
*	Patches for queued for master will be processed over the next week
*	Our patch wranglers Alex and Luca have been maintain staging
branches at oe-core-contrib/abelloni/master-next and
oe-core-contrib/lucaceresoli/master-next if you'd like to see what they've
tested.
*	AB-INT issues and open CVEs have both risen.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT. In
particular there is a long-standing qemuppc failure which needs
investigating ( <https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14824>

*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.2. See:

ncements.2FBugs>

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:

ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core

help facilitate this.
