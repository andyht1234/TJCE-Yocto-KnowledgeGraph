We have our image and it is working as we need.
We have an apt repo setup and working so that we can install additional packages within a deployment of the image.
However when we manually bitbake additional packages (e.g bitbake my-optional-recipe) which we want to make available within this apt repository by default only the package for my-optional-recipe gets built, although all the dependencies of my-optional-recipe get built, none of them are packaged. how do we make sure all the dependencies have packages built?

Best Regards

Dan

Are the dependencies in the recipe as RDEPENDS ? If so, they will be
built and packaged. If they weren't, then image assembly and pretty
much any package feed would be non-functional.

Just want to add that it seems to run the do_package task but not the do_package_write_deb one for each of the dependencies.

Yes, in RDPENDS, here's an example of an attempt at the equivalent of Ubuntu's build-essential package:

DESCRIPTION = "Informational list of build-essential pacakages"

inherit packagegroup

PACKAGES = "\
${PN} \
"

RDEPENDS:${PN} = "\
libc6-dev \
g++ \
gcc \
make \
"

INSANE_SKIP:${PN} = "dev-deps"

Just to be absolutely clear, here is the result of having run bitbake build-essential having first removed and thus started with a clean tmp dir.

dan@melon:/home/dan/workspace_ssd/kas/build$ find tmp/deploy/deb/
tmp/deploy/deb/
tmp/deploy/deb/all
tmp/deploy/deb/all/build-essential-ptest_1.0.0-r0.0_all.deb
tmp/deploy/deb/all/build-essential-dev_1.0.0-r0.0_all.deb
tmp/deploy/deb/all/build-essential_1.0.0-r0.0_all.deb
tmp/deploy/deb/all/build-essential-dbg_1.0.0-r0.0_all.deb

This is now expected behavior. I discovered it a few months ago in my package feed builds:
https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/topic/88553371#55926

Bitbake no longer does recursive packaging tasks since they are not always needed. To get all the recursive packages, you need to run bitbake --runall build build-essential
