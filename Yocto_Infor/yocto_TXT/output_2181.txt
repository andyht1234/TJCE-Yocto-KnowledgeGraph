We are moving several racks of servers to a new data center in order to
save on costs and reduce maintenance overhead.

Beginning Sat Feb 26 17:00 UTC 2022 / (9am PST)
Ending before Sun Feb 27 06:00 UTC 2022 / (10pm PST)

The following services will experience downtime during much of the outage
window:

Yocto Project Autobuilder (workers only)
downloads.yoctoproject.org
sstate.yoctoproject.org
sources.openembedded.org

These services will also be offline for a shorter period of time during the
window:

bugzilla.yoctoproject.org
IRC Logging
openembedded.org
wiki.yoctoproject.org

Because many of our services are interdependent there may be unexpected
issues with other services during the move.
