I have gone through documentation of the auto upgrade helper ,like how to use and prerequisites and all.
Can i get any examples like how to use the helper tool to upgrade a recipe,
Also how can i verify this tool like how it is working
for verifying i took a poky( *warrior* ) layer as a reference example .
With this i checked out older
commit hash ( https://git.yoctoproject.org/ cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?h= warrior&id= 0c011f61e67b33746b201db99bd258 42c083cfa7 ( https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?h=warrior&id=0c011f61e67b33746b201db99bd25842c083cfa7 ) ).
so that when i use the auto upgrade tool on any recipe which had older changes can get updated to current commit changes.
With this when i checked recipes and their versions map there were some recipes which had this version difference(eg: python: 3.7.2 present 3.7.7).
Now if I run the tool to update the python recipe (like *upgrade-helper.py python* ), I don't see any changes in the recipe at all.
I have followed the steps documented here:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ 3.2.4/dev-manual/dev-manual- common-tasks.html#using-the- auto-upgrade-helper-auh ( https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.2.4/dev-manual/dev-manual-common-tasks.html#using-the-auto-upgrade-helper-auh ).

Are these steps followed for verification steps  correct or if you can suggest any other procedure if you can suggest that will be helpful

I think it is better if you start with devtool (which is the utility that
AUH is using to perform the updates). The workflow is as follows:

$ devtool upgrade recipe-name additional-options
(fix any issues)
$ devtool finish python3 path/to/layer/ additional-options

Please check the available options, try the commands and ask here if
anything doesn't work or isn't clear.
