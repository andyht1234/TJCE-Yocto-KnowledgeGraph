  it does indeed fix the curl build error, thanks. i haven't tested
its operation yet, but getting a build was all i was after at the
moment.

  as i read it, this issue is also related to -pthread versus
-lpthread:

this would mean that you want to rely on side effects of -pthread
which may work with gcc but may not
work with clang or other compiler drivers. The issue you have is that
some variables are needing atomics
and solution is either you link with libatomic or avoid using the code
which needs them

  so while i'm still trying to wrap my head around all this, what
*would* be the ideal resolution for this? the link above suggests the
simple solution of introducing a gcc config option
"--always-link-libatomic". would that solve all this in a general way,
not just for RISC-V?

Probably, but again if you need a function from a library you include it on
linker cmdline if it’s intrinsics then compiler driver doing the needed is
best way
Preferably without introducing compiler specific options
