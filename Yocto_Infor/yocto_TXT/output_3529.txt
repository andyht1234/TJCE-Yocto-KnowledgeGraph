Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.1.7 was released.
*	Patches are now flowing into master for 3.4 for M1 which is now
undergoing active development.
*	We added automated yocto-check-layer testing to the YP autobuilder
for key project layers which include meta-openembedded and
meta-virtualization as well as member layers. The aim is to ensure key
project layers interoperate well with each other and we'd like to thank the
layer maintainers who've helped ensure these layers started passing tests.
*	Libseccomp has moved to OE-Core due to its widespread use and
becoming a hard requirement for some software. As such its now in the
default DISTRO_FEATURES.
*	There is a potentially controversial proposal to add opengl to the
default DISTRO_FEATURES as part of the move to wayland rather than X11
Xserver based systems which people may wish to review carefully.
*	Elections for the two OE positions on the YP TSC are ongoing on the
openembedded-members list. Please contact the OE board if you are not a
member but would like to be.
*	Intermittent autobuilder issues continue to occur and are now at a
record high level. You  can see the list of failures we're continuing to see
by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We are working to identify the load pattern on the infrastructure that seems
to trigger these.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.3. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.3_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.3_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
