Instead of just providing local.conf info, add layer names and their
revisions with bitbake version information into error report
makes it easier to understand and reproduce failed build.

Hi Richard,

It seems like patches sent for *error-report-web* are not much important to
the community as this patch has *not been reviewed/commented on* by
anyone *since
6th January 2021* (*more than 2.5 months*).

Still, I'm sending a reminder one last time for [*YOCTO #9700*].
https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/message/51891

Please review/comment on it so that things can move further.

Thanks & Regards,
Milan Shah

Sorry, that isn't true, they are important and appreciated. We're 
just struggling to handle everything.

The challenge/problem has been that there are much older patches which
were half merged and broke things. People have rightly been complaining
about those issues and Khem for example has been carrying a patch for 3
years to work arond that problem. I did figure out a fix for that which
has now been merged.

We also needed to migrate the service from py2 to py3 and deal with a
set of patches that had been applied locally that we had been unaware of
until very recently but which complicate things. The people who wrote 
them are no longer around to help with that.

The original authors of this code are no longer around, the people who
stepped up to try and help also haven't had time so the support/review
has struggled. The service is in daily use however so it is important
and that is why I'm now trying to unravel and fix things.

I do want to get to your patch but you can appreciate that adding it 
directly on top of an already failing set of changes wouldn't be good
for anyone.

We are making progress in resolving the issues so I hope to get some
kind of better answer to you soon.

Cheers,

Richard

Thanks, Richard for responding.

I completely understood your point and appreciate the effort you people
make to maintain these repositories.

But as a contributor, It encourages me to contribute more when my work gets
noticed/criticized/accepted by the community.

Anyways, I hope that the community resolves these issues as soon as
possible so that there won't be much delay in updating the patches sent by
the contributors.

Thanks & Regards,
Milan Shah

It appears to have merged 5 months ago?

Also, looking at the patch that inherit base should not be there and needs
to be removed since everything always inherits base.

In the future please send OE-Core changes to the openembedded-core mailing
list as that will speed up review and patch handling (as per the repo's README).

Cheers,

Richard

Well, there was no update on the bug as well as on the patch so I was not
aware of it.

Thanks, Richard for responding. I'll definitely follow your suggestion next
time.

Thanks & Regards,
Milan Shah

We'd normally expect the bug owner to update the status of the bug since it
isn't really possible for me or the triage team to track and update them all.
We can close this one with a link to the commit:

http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/meta/classes/report-error.bbclass?id=8b299a62c55aa8d1583aff4b8428f16def7231b7

Happy for you to, or I can...

Cheers,

Richard
