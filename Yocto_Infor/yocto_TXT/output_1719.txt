Hi,

What is best way to cross compile an out-of-tree kernel module with a yocto SDK?

The kernel headers get included in the SDK after the following line is included in the image definition
`TOOLCHAIN_TARGET_TASK:append = " kernel-devsrc" `
but I don't see how scripts such as fixdep or modpost (should be built for host arch) get included in the SDK

Is rebuilding the fixdep and modpost on the host machine after installing the yocto SDK, and then building the out-of-tree kernel module a correct approach?

Thanks,
Fanzhe
