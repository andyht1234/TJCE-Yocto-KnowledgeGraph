Explicitly fail in process_verity if no KEY-VALUE lines are converted.

It seems that verity images are not building correctly with INHERIT +=
"rm_work". Some debugging later it was clear that veritysetup is silently
failing, as the output is piped to process_verity shell function, which masks
the exit code of veritysetup.
