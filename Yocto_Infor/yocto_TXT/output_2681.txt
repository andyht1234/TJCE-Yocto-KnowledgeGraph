No, you got it wromg... I have a buildable image which has all the components necessary, I want to remove some overhead installed by some components that I will not be within my running application...

  i would think start with defining a minimal image, then define other images based on that one which add more recipes. this has nothing to do with redefining the recipes, it just means defining more than one image.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this. It helps if you provide
specifics: what components and what portions of them and why.

Hello Steve,

Is the approach where you remove the recipes from the image an option?
Is there a reason why you want to build the recipes that you do not want to appear in your image?

Regards,

Leon.

The super yoctoish way would be to alter the packaging of the recipe to 
your needs.

Let's assume recipe-a consists of the files

foo
bar

and it would package both files into recipe-a pkg.

In the actual image you only install packages into a file system, so if 
you don't want bar to be installed into your final image, it'd be best 
to package bar into a separate package.

PACKAGES_BEFORE_PN = "${PN}-bar"
FILES:${PN}-bar = "bar"

in this case the recipe would produce

recipe-a (containing just foo)
recipe-a-bar (containing just bar)

You could install now (via IMAGE_INSTALL in your image recipe) just add 
recipe-a and only foo would be put into the final image.

While a potential other image (IMAGE_INSTALL += "recipe-a-bar recipe-a")
would contain both.

But if you'd go down that road you have to make sure that runtime 
dependencies between the packages are met (using REDEPENDS:* 
statements), as otherwise it could turn into very hard to debug issues.
So I would propose to **not** do that via bbappends, but forks of the 
recipes you want to repackage.

Another option (as likely mentioned already) is to use

rem_stuff() {
    rm ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/<file you want to delete>
}

ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND += "rem_stuff;"

in your image recipe

Is there a reason why you want to build the recipes that you do not
want to appear in your image?
