Hi,

I am building following imx6ulz-kobs.dts file to a dtb in zeus:

$ cat imx6ulz-kobs.dts

#include "imx6ulz.dts"

/{
  model = "customized imx6ull";
  compatible = "fsl,imx6ull";
};

&gpmi {
    /delete-node/ fsl,use-minimum-ecc;
};

The building process was fine, but that fsl,use-minimum-ecc in dtb was
not deleted, is it a bug or it does not support  /delete-node/?

Thank you.

fsl,use-minimum-ecc is a property not a node, you need to use /delete-property/ instead, c.f. https://devicetree-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter6-source-language.html?highlight=delete-property#node-and-property-definitions.

Cheers,
Quentin
