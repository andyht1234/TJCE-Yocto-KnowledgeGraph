I'm on Kirkstone using core-image-full-cmdline image.  Is there a way to add adjtimex besides busybox?  I did not see an adjtimex recipe in kirkstone.

Thanks

Gary

there is not one. Perhaps straightforward to create from

Is there a reason you don’t want to use the busybox applet?

There doesn’t appear to be a recipe for adjtimex in the layer index either, but considering the last release was in 2010 it’s pretty dead upstream. Writing a recipe should be a trivial task if you really don’t want to use busybox.
