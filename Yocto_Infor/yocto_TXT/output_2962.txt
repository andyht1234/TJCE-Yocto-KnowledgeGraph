Key Status/Updates:

*	We are now at feature freeze for YP 3.4
*	Read-only PRServ and switch to asyncio was merged
*	Rust merging to core is proving problematic due to issues
interacting with uninative. These cause many strange autobuilder failures so
this issue would have to be addressed in the next day or two in order to be
in 3.4.
*	glibc 2.34 and the merge of the various libraries into libc is
causing significant problems for pseudo. This issue is causing significant
worry as the project will struggle as distros adopt the new glibc version
unless we work out how to fix things.
*	The tune file layout change was merged.
*	We are still hoping to get some of the planned SBOM work into 3.4
*	Intermittent issues are ongoing and help is very much welcome on
these issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to see by
searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
