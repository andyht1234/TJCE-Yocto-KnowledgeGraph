Key Status/Updates:

*	We are now at feature freeze for 3.5, our next LTS release
*	YP 3.3.5 is out of QA and pending release approval
*	Inclusive language changes have merged however there are still:

*	Incompatible license related variable changes
*	Function variable name changes needed
*	No migration documentation or documentation of the changes
*	No documentation of the bitbake rename code
*	No updates to the manual for the variable renames

We do need people to pull things together and finish things off, help in
doing that is needed and much appreciated.

*	There is a pending patch to warn about old style license identifiers
pending in master-next and due to be posted for review. On balance this is
probably a good thing to get into the LTS but we're open to input on that.
*	The incompatible license changes will mean anyone using those
variables will need to update what they're doing carefully. Patches in
master-next now pass testing and are due to be posted on the mailing list.
*	The python build process change to use wheels has merged. That
change has caused some disruption but was close enough to being ready it
seemed worth making the final push for inclusion.
*	The infrastructure move was successful and all services should be
restored. There are some networking issues occurring on autobuilder builds
which are preventing release builds at this time and are being looked into.
*	As such, the M3 release build will likely happen late this week or
early next week.
*	If people see intermittent issues in their own builds, particularly
if they're the same as intermittent issues seen on the autobuilder, please
do comment in the bugs mentioning when they happen as the frequency
information does help us prioritize fixing the most common issues.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at record high levels and help is
very much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of
failures we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in
bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:

*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.5. See:

ncements.2FBugs>

*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
