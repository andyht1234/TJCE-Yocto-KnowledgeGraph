Some background of what I am trying to achieve.
I am updating my build to kirkstone from dunfell and which I have did, except the SDK part.
This is where we have common API and it requires so files like libc.so.0 and libpthread.so.0 but it's not available in GLIBC 3.5 which is the GLIBC of kirkstone.
GLIBC is of course backward compatible and we can deal with it later.
When I try to make the nativesdk recipe of commonapi, it works with INSANE SKIP file-rdeps but when I make the main imagine that includes this commonapi and then make the SDK image, it gives out the error again
How can I ignore this warning of .so file dependencies when it is SDK we are dealing with even INSANE SKIP doesn't work on it.
