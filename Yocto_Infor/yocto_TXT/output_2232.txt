Done.

I closed 3 prelink issues as obsolete:

1.Prelink: doesn't work on ppc64
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1331

2. Investigate if -mtls-dialect=gnu2 support within the prelinker behavior
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8664

3. On-target binutils produces non-running code when linking with 
"-Wl,-z,nocopyreloc" on ARM or PPC
"The prelink test suite has two tests (reloc8 and reloc9) that attempt 
to link an application with "-Wl,-z,nocopyreloc". This worked through 
"krogoth" but no longer works on master. ..."

https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10168

The remaining issues that mention prelink, do NOT appear to be
ones that we can resolve as the prelink package/feature is only involved 
tangentially.
