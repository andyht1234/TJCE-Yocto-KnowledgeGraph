All,

 

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a
newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 392
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.4", "3.5, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.4" and then "3.5".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla
account).  The list is at:
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage_Archive#Unassigned_or_Newcomer
_Bugs

 

Thanks,

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a
newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means
people can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the
appropriate heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.



Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 423
unassigned or newcomer bugs.



We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help
out with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things
don't work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want
to add to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority"
classes right now,  “4.3”, “4.4”, "4.99" and "Future", the more
pressing/urgent issues being in "4.3" and then “4.4”.



Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com)
an e-mail with the bug number you would like and I will assign it to you
(please make sure you have a Bugzilla account).  The list is at:
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage_Archive#Unassigned_or_Newcomer_Bugs

newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 434
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now,  "4.3", "4.4", "4.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent
issues being in "4.3" and then "4.4".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla
account).  The list is at:

can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 423
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now,  "4.2", "4.3", "4.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent
issues being in "4.2" and then "4.3".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla

can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 415
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now,  "4.2", "4.3", "4.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent
issues being in "4.2" and then "4.3".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla

can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 413
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now,  "4.2", "4.3", "4.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent
issues being in "4.2" and then "4.3".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla

newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 410
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now,  "4.1", "4.2", "4.3", "4.99" and "Future", the more
pressing/urgent issues being in "4.1" and then "4.2".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla
account).  The list is at:

newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 410
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now,  "4.1", "4.2", "4.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent
issues being in "4.1" and then "4.2".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla
account).  The list is at:

can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 418
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now,  "4.1", "4.2", "4.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent
issues being in "4.1" and then "4.2".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla

can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 397
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now,  "3.5, "3.6", "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent
issues being in "3.5" and then "3.6".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla

can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 394
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.4", "3.5, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.4" and then "3.5".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla

heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 395
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.4", "3.5, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.4" and then "3.5".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would

how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 379
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.2", "3.3, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.2" and then "3.3".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com

please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 353
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.2", "3.3, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.2" and then "3.3".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com

fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 362
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.2", "3.3, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.2" and then "3.3".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com

All,

 

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a
newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 366
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add

with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.2", "3.3, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.2" and then "3.3".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla

All,

 

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a
newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 336
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add

All,

 

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a
newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded and
how to create a bugzilla account at:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/createaccount.cgi

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 322
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.2", "3.3, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.2" and then "3.3".

All,

 

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a
newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs  Also please
review:
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 339
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.2", "3.3, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.2" and then "3.3".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would
like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla
account).  The list is at:
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage_Archive#Unassigned_or_Newcomer

Thanks,

All,

 

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a
newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

 

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs

 

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 374
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.1", "3.2, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.1" and then "3.2".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would

All,

 

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a
newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

 

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs

 

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 313
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.1", "3.2, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.1" and then "3.2".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would

All,

 

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a
newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
heading:

 

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs

 

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work
on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 294
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "3.1", "3.2, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues
being in "3.1" and then "3.2".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com
<mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> ) an e-mail with the bug number you would

We (the triage team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 298 unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes right now, “3.1”, “3.2, "3.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent issues being in "3.1" and then “3.2”.

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help with either take ownership of the bug, or send me ( <mailto:sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com> sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com) an e-mail with the bug number you would like and I will assign it to you (please make sure you have a Bugzilla account).

All,

 

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate heading:

 

 <https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs> https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Newcomer_Bugs

 

The idea is these bugs should be straight forward for a person to help work on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help, please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the things we hear users report is they don't know how to help.

on who doesn't have deep experience with the project.  If anyone can help,
please take ownership of the bug and send patches!  If anyone needs
help/advice there are people on irc who can likely do so, or some of the
more experienced contributors will likely be happy to help too.

 

Also, the triage team meets weekly and does its best to handle the bugs
reported into the Bugzilla. The number of people attending that meeting has
fallen, as have the number of people available to help fix bugs. One of the
things we hear users report is they don't know how to help. We (the triage
team) are therefore going to start reporting out the currently 297
unassigned or newcomer bugs.

 

We're hoping people may be able to spare some time now and again to help out
with these.  Bugs are split into two types, "true bugs" where things don't
work as they should and "enhancements" which are features we'd want to add
to the system.  There are also roughly four different "priority" classes
right now, "2.8", "2.9', "2.99" and "Future", the more pressing/urgent
issues being in "2.8" and then "2.9".

 

Please review this link and if a bug is something you would be able to help
with either take ownership of the bug, or send me (sjolley.yp.pm@gmail.com)
an e-mail with the bug number you would like and I will assign it to you
(please make sure you have a Bugzilla account).  The list is at:
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Unassigned_or_Newcomer_Bugs

All,

 

The triage team is starting to try and collect up and classify bugs which a
newcomer to the project would be able to work on in a way which means people
can find them. They're being listed on the triage page under the appropriate
