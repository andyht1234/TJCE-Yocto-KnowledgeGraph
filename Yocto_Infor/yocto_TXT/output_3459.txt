Hi All,
I integrated python3-numpy in my image and when trying to import it I get this error: (python3 version: 3.7.7)

IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!

Importing the numpy c-extensions failed.
- Try uninstalling and reinstalling numpy.
- If you have already done that, then:
1. Check that you expected to use Python3.7 from "/usr/bin/python3",
and that you have no directories in your PATH or PYTHONPATH that can
interfere with the Python and numpy version "1.17.0" you're trying to use.
2. If (1) looks fine, you can open a new issue at
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues.  Please include details on:
- how you installed Python
- how you installed numpy
- your operating system
- whether or not you have multiple versions of Python installed
- if you built from source, your compiler versions and ideally a build log

- If you're working with a numpy git repository, try `git clean -xdf`
(removes all files not under version control) and rebuild numpy.

Note: this error has many possible causes, so please don't comment on
an existing issue about this - open a new one instead.

Original error was: No module named 'numpy.core._multiarray_umath'
----------

Did any one encounter this issue?

Thanks,
Talel

According to [1] yes - you might want to consider back porting one of 
the more recent versions of numpy from [2], as you are using a pretty 
outdated one

[1] 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54665842/when-importing-tensorflow-i-get-the-following-error-no-module-named-numpy-cor
[2] http://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/recipe/51338/

Also the github issue tracker of numpy contains at least one issue of 
the same sort
