Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.2 M1 is due to be built this week, likely once we merge a few
remaining patches and hopefully some CVE fixes.
*	Thanks to everyone who attended or helped contribute to the Yocto
Summit, it seemed to be a success and had some good presentations!
*	There are a number of bitbake patches pending with an unresolved
dilemma on functionality versus parsing speeds.
*	CVEs in master have risen with 7 across 5 components, help in
bringing the numbers down would be appreciated
*	We are starting to see some rough plans around Y2038, largefile
support and some other topics, thanks to all those helping move this
forward, there has been some useful discussion and we look forward to seeing
the changes!
*	We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.
*	As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components
which are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying
to keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex,
devtool, toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more.
Many have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
components!

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.2. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.2_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
