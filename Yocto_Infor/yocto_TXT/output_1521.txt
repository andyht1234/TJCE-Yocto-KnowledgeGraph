Key Status/Updates:
 * YP 3.1.18 was released
 * YP 4.0.3 is due to build this week but we need the glibc and kernel
   reproducibility fixes first
 * Major changes to the rust toolchain build process were merged and
   this enables target rust, cross SDK and automated SDK testing. Sadly
   some issues remain and are stopping enabling the tests by default.
 * We have finally tracked down and worked out a fix for the kernel
   reproducibility issue which appeared in recent 5.15 stable updates.
   It was a config option which changed depending on whether /bin/sh
   was dash or bash.
 * The 5.19 kernel uprev is nearly ready to merge as the final build
   issues look to have been addressed.
 * The base glibc 2.36 patches have merged but not the actual upgrade
   yet.
 * We had some infrastructure issues over the weekend which impacted
   the autobuilder. Combined with a number of complex patch
   submissions, this has meant there are patches backlogged.
 * A number of new CVEs appeared in master this week so help would be
   much appreciated in addressing those.
 * The debug file mapping issues are stalled due to developer bandwidth
   limitations.
 * Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re
   continuing to see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

Ways to contribute:
 * There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
 * There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassign
   ed_Enhancements.2FBugs
 * We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
   list at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/incl
   ude/maintainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask
   on the OE-Core mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to
   “Unassigned” soon to help facilitate this.
