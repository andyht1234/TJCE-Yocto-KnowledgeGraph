I have to execute a script to setup static IP address of the ARM board. This I need to do it on first boot of the Yocto Linux. I wrote post install script to do it, but it doesn't print interactive messages to user asking for IP address, netmask, gateway etc. i.e. it doesn't print echo and read messages.
I need to run this script only once on first boot of the ARM board.
Kindly suggest me a way to display echo/read messages to make setup script more interactive.
