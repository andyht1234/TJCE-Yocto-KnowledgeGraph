Hello all,

I updated the layers of my project to the current dunfell branch tips. See here: https://gitlab.com/manuel_wagesreither/bora-proj/-/commit/de631634d7556987d2551d0cedca8f67530bc78d

Since then, the build is failing with the following message:
```
ERROR: ParseError at /home/manuel/bora-proj/meta-openembedded/meta-oe/conf/layer.conf:104: unparsed line: 'DEFAULT_TEST_SUITES:pn-meta-oe-ptest-image = " ${PTESTTESTSUITE}"'
```

Indeed this line, and even more the one after look strange.
https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded/blob/master/meta-oe/conf/layer.conf#L104
```
DEFAULT_TEST_SUITES:pn-meta-oe-ptest-image = " ${PTESTTESTSUITE}"

NON_MULTILIB_RECIPES:append = " crash"
```

When I replace the : with _, things seem to work. I can't make sense of that. Did the syntax change? If so, why doesn't bitbake understand the new syntax? I thought bitbake is included in one of the layers.

Thanks, Regards,
Manuel

Note that you are using the master branch of meta-oe              ^^^^^^^^

If you use the dunfell branch you won't have this issue.

There was an OVERRIDE syntax change and this is what are seeing.
Some layers, like meta-openembedded incorporated this change into their 
master branch. So either you need to update all your layers as well, or 
you need to use meta-openembedded with a branch/commit before the change.

Regards,

Robert

I feel like an idiot right now. Thank you! With dunfell it builds indeed.

Now I have to deal with the following:
```
ERROR: Layer multimedia-layer is not compatible with the core layer which only supports these series: dunfell (layer is compatible with honister)
```

I guess I'll have to analyze the layers .conf file to see where that comes from.

Thanks, Manuel

We've all done this sort of thing :-)

Looks like another case of the layer's master/honister branch instead
of dunfell.

says it works with dunfell releases and depends on core and meta-python 
layers. So I wonder what release are you using for core

Alright, thanks for the info. Did they switch from the underline _ to a colon : as seperator? Guess underline was becoming ambigous.

My bad again. I had the modified layer.conf still in my meta-oe directory, and this prevented kas from switching to the new commit. Fixed this and build now runs.
