Hello Community,

My CMake project needs to cross compile (.c sources) using libxml2.

  *   The CMakeLists.txt has "find_package(LibXml2)"
  *   The recipe.bb has
     *   "DEPENDS += "libxml2"
     *   "inherit cmake"

It does not work. "do_configure" returns error it cannot set LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR and LIBXML2_LIBRARY.

  *   I assume I need to add "set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH <some sysroot path>)" but don't know how to specify the <some sysroot path>.
  *   Perhaps I need to specify something to EXTRA_OECMAKE but don't know what this is.

Greatly appreciate if someone can offer help.

Many thanks,
Stephen

I think you may need to inherit pkgconfig class too if your cmake relies 
on this to find packages.

Cheers,
Quentin
