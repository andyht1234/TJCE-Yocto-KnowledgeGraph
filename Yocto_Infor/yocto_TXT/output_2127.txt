I am working on a BSP build using Yocto. My physical board has two DSI ports to which panels are connected. Both are 4-lane DSI panels. Panels are defined in device tree and they are initialized and loaded by kernel using the correct driver. However only one frame buffer and console is created /dev/fb0 , /dev/fbcon. I can see through dmesg logs one fbdev is also created.Â On one panel i can see the console, other panel nothing showed up.
I am not using any physical bridge. I wanted to know how fbdev is created? How i can create another frame buffer?

Please correct me if i am missing some thing here.
