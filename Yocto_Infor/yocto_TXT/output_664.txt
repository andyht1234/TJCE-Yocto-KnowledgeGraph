A while back, we had some discussion about how CROPS was being used and 
how we wanted people to reuse the work Tim and others in the project had 
been doing with CROPS. Tim and I had a few discussions over the past 
month or two and I've created a tool that I'd like some additional eyes 
on now.

crop-generator (https://github.com/crops/crops-generator) is a KConfig 
based dockerfile generator that uses the published crops container and 
generates custom docker containers for people. The current features 
exist around the use cases of people wanting to use crops but add their 
own packages or toolchains/sdks.

You will need to install pykconfiglib 
(https://pypi.org/project/kconfiglib/), docker, docker buildkit and 
kconfig-frontends.

# To bring up the menu and generate a .config:
kconfig-mconf ./Kconfig

# Convert the .config to a Dockerfile with associated files:
./crops_generator.py --kconf .config --docker <containercontext>

# Build the container
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build <containercontext>
