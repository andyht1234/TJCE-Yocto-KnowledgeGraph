I was attempting an image build with Yocto Hardknott, and I ran into a
chown problem during do_rootfs(). I traced it down to
${WORKDIR}/intercept_scripts showing up in the PSEUDO_IGNORE_PATHS
environment variable.

This commit made the change:
https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/commit/meta/classes/image.bbclass?id=9463be2292b942a1072eea88881b9644e55aadb9

I continued down the rabbit hole until I got here:
https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/tree/meta/lib/oe/package_manager/__init__.py#n173

Line 192 specifically is the smoking gun. The files are being copied from
poky/scripts/postinst-intercepts into the ${WORKDIR}/intercept_scripts
directory and immediately failing when the copyFile utility attempts to do
a chown.

Is there any logical explanation for this? Is this a bug or am I doing
something wrong? Is there a workaround?
