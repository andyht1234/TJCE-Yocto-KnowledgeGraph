Hi,

I'm quite new with yocto project and i did not find the answer from manual. Currently I have project, where i can make SDK with ARM binaries and those works fine. Now i have faced the situation where i need also x86 binaries. Is it possible to make one SDK which includes both ARM and x86 binaries? And if so, is it possible to do like own .bb file to x86 so i could clarify what i need to take in to x86?

The SDKs are designed around having a single toolchain and sysroot, so the
answer is no. You need to make two SDKs from two build trees.
