Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.1.23 is due to be released.
*	We are due to build M3 and are at feature freeze for YP 4.2.
*	We saw further version upgrades this week and a number of bitbake
hang fixes or fixes for exits with no output. There are a few remaining
issues to conclude then we should be in a good position to build M3.
*	CVE levels in master are reducing. The remaining concern is the
large number of linux-yocto CVEs which have shown up since we last updated
the exclusion lists. The full list can be seen here:
<https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/patchmetrics/cve-status-master
.txt>
https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/patchmetrics/cve-status-master.
txt

Help in resolving these so we can remove the exclusion on linux-yocto on all
reports would be appreciated.

*	We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components
which are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying
to keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex,
devtool, toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more.
Many have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
components!
*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.2. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.2_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
