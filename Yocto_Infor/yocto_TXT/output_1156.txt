 systemd-timesyncd uses /var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock to maintain a
monotonic system time across reboots even in the presence of RTC failures.
If this file doesn't exist, "at the minimum, it will be set to the systemd
build date".

I dug through systemd's build process, and found that it will get that
build date from either the timestamp of the NEWS file or, if it's set, the
environment variable SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH. So, great, that means this is
already accessible through Yocto's reproducible build infrastructure. But
the catch is, that variable is listed in BB_BASEHASH_IGNORE_VARS, meaning
that just setting SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH from a bbappend or
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH:pn-systemd from a conf file doesn't actually cause the
recipe to be re-run when I change the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH. It also means that
other developers with their own sstate might continue creating builds for
themselves indefinitely that don't take my SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH into account,
until such time as they happen to run a -c clean or systemd's recipe gets
upgraded for another reason.

I don't think I want to remove SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH from the
BB_BASEHASH_IGNORE_VARS globally, but removing it from
BB_BASEHASH_IGNORE_VARS with a systemd_%.bbappend appears to have no effect
(even though `bitbake -e systemd` shows that my :remove is being processed
correctly).

A hack that I've thought of is setting PR .= ".${SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH}" but I
can't help thinking there must be a better way.

Anybody have any advice on how to get Yocto to do what I want it to?
