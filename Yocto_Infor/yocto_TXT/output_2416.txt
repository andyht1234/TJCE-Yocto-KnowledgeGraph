Hi:

This just started happening today.

Both
shared-mime-info-native-1.15-r0 do_fetch
and
shared-mime-info-1.15-r0 do_fetch

Never complete.   Bitbake completes all other non-dependant recipes, leaving the 2 above to go forever, but never finish.

Anybody else seeing this?   Is this a case of a remote repo not functioning properly?

Thanks
Howard

I should point out that nothing changed on my end and this was all building fine Friday Dec 24, and now it does not build on Monday Dec 27.

Ok so for some reason the repo for shared-mime-info is offline.

I just ran a simple git clone of:

git clone git://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/shared-mime-info.git;protocol=https

and it never completes or even starts near as I can tell.

The src URI above is what is specified in the recipe.

I think it's just holiday season and freedesktop infra went down with no
one to fix it. Give it a few days, it'll come back.
