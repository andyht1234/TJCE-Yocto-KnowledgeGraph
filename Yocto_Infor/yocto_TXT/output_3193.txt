Hi,

I'm trying to upgrade our connman recipe to 1.39 or 1.40 version, but when I try to build our image, it fails in "do_configure" because it can't find libmnl.
This is the exact output of my connman/1.40-r0/build/config.log

configure:14443: checking for libmnl >= 1.0.0
configure:14450: $PKG_CONFIG --exists --print-errors "libmnl >= 1.0.0"
Package libmnl was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libmnl.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'libmnl' found
configure:14453: $? = 1
configure:14467: $PKG_CONFIG --exists --print-errors "libmnl >= 1.0.0"
Package libmnl was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libmnl.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'libmnl' found
configure:14470: $? = 1
configure:14484: result: no
No package 'libmnl' found
configure:14500: error: libmnl >= 1.0.0 not found

My libmnl recipe is located inside poky ./poky/meta/recipes-extended/libmnl/libmnl_1.0.4.bb . This error only happens with connman 1.39 or 1.40.
I appreciate any help or suggestions off a better place to ask this questions since is connman related.

Thanks,
Ignacio.

1.40 is already in oe-core master you should be able to backport the recipe
from there.

libnml dependency was already added with wireguard PACKAGECONFIG in 1.38
