Hi!
I'm trying to build Tailscale with Yocto
This is me recipe:

inherit go-mod

SRC_URI = "git://github.com/tailscale/tailscale;protocol=https;branch=main"
SRCREV = "30d9201a11ebc2e3a0f17bf8963956b77dadeb5d"

GO_IMPORT = "tailscale.com"
GO_WORKDIR = "${GO_IMPORT}"
GO_INSTALL = "\
${GO_IMPORT}/cmd/tailscale \
${GO_IMPORT}/cmd/tailscaled \
"

do_install() {
install -d ${D}/${bindir}
install -d ${D}/${sbindir}
install ${B}/bin/tailscale ${D}/${bindir}/tailscale
install ${B}/bin/tailscaled ${D}/${sbindir}/tailscaled
}

However, build step ends up with errors like these (full log):

| wgengine/netstack/netstack.go:34:2: gvisor.dev/gvisor@v0.0.0-20230504175454-7b0a1988a28f: Get "https://proxy.golang.org/gvisor.dev/gvisor/@v/v0.0.0-20230504175454-7b0a1988a28f.zip": dial tcp: lookup proxy.golang.org on 8.8.8.8:53: dial udp 8.8.8.8:53: connect: network is unreachable

On some resources I have found it was recomended to add environmental variables: `GOPROXY="direct"` and `GOSUMDB="off"`, but it didn't helped.

Maybe someone has some ideas what is the cause of these errors?

You need to allow network connection for the do_compile task

do_compile[network] = "1"

We really shouldn't suggest the above to a developer without also the
explanation as to why network access is disabled by default in tasks
such as compile.

Your build may in fact work once you've allowed go to fetch its
dependencies / modules, but you will also not have reproducibility, a
full license report or sstate/download reuse (things you'd get from
fetcher integration).

If none of those things are significant to you, then by all means, you
can just allow go fetching in do_compile()

For more details on the options and the long discussions on the topic
in the past, I'd suggest searching the oe-core mailing list archives.

You are of course right with your objections. However, this is the only 
way I know of to get around this problem. Reproducibility is not a must 
have requirement for me, but I use some gtk go programs and would love 
to have a way to build at least gotk3 shared, since it takes quite a 
long time and has to be rebuilt for each program.
I had experimented with this some time ago, but it looked to me like 
there was no easy solution to this problem. This is somehow quite a 
conflict between different concepts.

Hei,

Golang does have the required features to support this, but it is more of a challenge to convince the repo owners to start using this.
You can download all of the dependencies in golang with go mod vendor and then store the vendor-folder to the repo as well.
But, the repo will get a lot larger that way. But, that fulfills the Yocto demands as far as I know.

Best Regards,


Janne KiiskilÃ¤

yes go mod vendor is a way to get this working in a reasonable way.
This also avoid go's module management coming in way of
bitbake fetcher.

As a distro, I think this should be even preferred even though size is
bigger and several modules will be duplicated per recipe if
there are other go packages in image. As a developer this might be not
preferred however.

Yes, again, if you read the mailing list discussions on this in the
past, we are well aware of what golang does (and doesn't do) and the
options to fully integrate into the core capabilities via a dedicated
fetcher.

But no one has stepped up to implement a fully integrated solution, so
we have proposals only as this point.

I've gone a different way with meta-virtualization and am using large
SRC_URIs with the dependencies fetched to allow full integration with
the fetcher, and still build reproducible go binaries.

What Yocto release are you using? I tried building Tailscale with
Dunfell but the version of Go it includes was too old.

I'am using Mickledore, with Go 1.20.5

I got successful build with following recipe:

GO_IMPORT = "tailscale.com"
GO_WORKDIR = "${GO_IMPORT}"
GO_INSTALL = "\
${GO_IMPORT}/cmd/tailscale \
${GO_IMPORT}/cmd/tailscaled \
"

do_compile() {
${GO} install ${GOBUILDFLAGS} ${GO_INSTALL}
}

do_compile[network] = "1"

do_install() {
install -d ${D}/${bindir}
install -d ${D}/${sbindir}
install ${B}/bin/linux_arm/tailscale ${D}/${bindir}/tailscale
install ${B}/bin/linux_arm/tailscaled ${D}/${sbindir}/tailscaled
if ${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'systemd', 'true', 'false', d)}; then
install -d ${D}${sysconfdir}/default/
install -m 0644 ${WORKDIR}/build/src/${GO_IMPORT}/cmd/tailscaled/tailscaled.defaults ${D}${sysconfdir}/default/tailscaled
install -d ${D}${systemd_unitdir}/system
install -m 0644 ${WORKDIR}/build/src/${GO_IMPORT}/cmd/tailscaled/tailscaled.service ${D}${systemd_unitdir}/system/tailscaled.service
install -d ${D}${sysconfdir}/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/
ln -s ${systemd_unitdir}/system/tailscaled.service ${D}${sysconfdir}/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/tailscaled.service
fi
}

SYSTEMD_PACKAGES = "${PN}"
SYSTEMD_SERVICE:${PN} = "tailscaled.service"
SYSTEMD_AUTO_ENABLE = "enable"

It's usingÂ do_compile[network] = "1" as was mentioned in this topic to omit network isolation.

I'm not particularly pleased with defining compile task for this recipe as it should use task from go.bbclass, but without it it gave me following error:

| 2023/07/05 12:35:55 duplicated definition of symbol tailscale.com/util/singleflight.(*Group[go.shape.string,go.shape.struct { tailscale.com/net/dnscache.ip net/netip.Addr; tailscale.com/net/dnscache.ip6 net/netip.Addr; tailscale.com/net/dnscache.allIPs []net/netip.Addr }]).doCall.func2, from tailscale.com/derp/derphttp and main

I'm not really familiar with Go, so I have no idea what's the cause of this error.
