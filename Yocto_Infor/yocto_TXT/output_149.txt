Hi folk
I did a bitbake virtual/kernel -c menuconfig in order to try and get the firewall stuff, particularly ip_tables, present.

At the end it asked me about a filename to save the changes to and I  gave it a new one (custom-mpet.config)
It seems this file is stored yocto/build/tmp/work/phyboard_pollux_imx8mp_2-phytec-linux/linux-imx/5.10.72-r0.0/build, not 100% sure thats right but thats where I found it.

Now the simple question is how do I get it to build with this new config and check that it indeed has?

I found on the internet the command bitbake virtual/kernel -c compile -f; bitbake virtual/kernel which does at least appear to do something, just not sure if it really is building what I expect.
Certainly on the finished build I get
root@phyboard-pollux-imx8mp-2:~# modprobe ip_tables
modprobe: FATAL: Module ip_tables not found in directory /lib/modules/5.10.72-bsp-yocto-nxp-i.mx8mp-pd22.1.1
root@phyboard-pollux-imx8mp-2:~#


which doesnt look too encouraging. I am sure there is documentation somewhere but google hasnt found anything particularly helpful at the moment. I am still new to yocto but finding the right documentation works but there is a lot of other documentation out there :0 (same as most things to be honest)

BR
Dave

You can use that generated full .config file as documented at the start of:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#changing-the-configuration

However, often the better option is to run `-c menuconfig`, let it save as .config, and
then run `-c diffconfig`. This produces a small configuration fragment that includes just the
changes you made. See:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/kernel-dev/common.html#creating-configuration-fragments

The basic process for that is make a kernel .bbappend in your custom layer, that includes the
fragment as a SRC_URL ending in .cfg into the kernel build. If that is done the kernel recipe
(via one of the kernel bbclasses) takes care of merging your configuration with the default.
