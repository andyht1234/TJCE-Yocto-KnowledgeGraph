Hello all,

I have a device on which the main application is a C++ based GUI. I'm
working on implementing an A/B update strategy using swupdate with the
firmware being hosted on a AWS S3 bucket. The user needs to be able to use
the GUI to check for updates & if available apply them (I can implement
this by passing the filename to the swupdate client).

I see AWS have their own layer but can anyone point to a strategy/ resource
on how to query files in an S3 bucket from a C++ application?

Many thanks,
