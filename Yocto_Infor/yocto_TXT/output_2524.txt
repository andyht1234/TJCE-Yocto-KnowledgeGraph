Hi,

Trying to install buildtools (dunfell) I get

./sources/openembedded-core/scripts/install-buildtools
INFO: Fetching buildtools installer
ERROR: Could not download file from
http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/milestones/yocto-3.2_M1/buildtools/x86_64-buildtools-extended-nativesdk-standalone-3.1%2Bsnapshot-20200617.sh

Has anybody a chance to help me not being killed :)

Cheers,

Andreas

downloads.yoctoproject.org is back online with additional redundancy.

The cause of the outage will take some time to investigate as the drive
