From: "Kristian Klausen via lists.yoctoproject.org" <kristian=klausen.dk@lists.yoctoproject.org>

swtpm no longer depends on Python[1] so the dependencies have been
removed.

"inherit perlnative" has been added due to (in oe-core):
deda455b3c ("bitbake.conf: drop pod2man from hosttools")

Some leftover dependencies have also been removed, ex: tpm-tools
required in the past by swtpm_setup.sh (<0.4.0)[2].

expect is there twice now (+ native). Would expect-native be enough or 
do we also need expect?

expect is needed as a runtime dependency for swtpm-create-tpmca, but I 
added it as a recommended dependency as I don't think all people are 
interesting in swtpm-create-tpmca working out-of-the-box.
expect should still be here, no?

expect-native only fixes the build issue.
