Hello Everyone,
I have generated two build with different platform for same targetÂ  (core-image-minimal) and for same yocto release "dunfell" . One image I have generated with the help of yocto project and one is from "KAS" by making YML File .Now I am not getting any suitable way of differentiation between these two binary files for following reason .
1. Are those build same or not .
2. There version are same or not .
4. Those Hash keys same or not .
3. What things could be different ?
I am trying to find out the way so i could do comparison between those binary files .
Your replies would be appreciated . Thanks in advance
