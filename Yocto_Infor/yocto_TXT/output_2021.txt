[list address fixed, sorry]

We've been having bandwidth trouble with downloads.yoctoproject.org so we did
some quick analysis to see what the issue is. Basically in speeding up the
server which was the rate limit, we hit the limits of the hosting pipe. I'd note
a few things:

a) it isn't the sstate mirroring, it is nearly all being used by downloads.

b) 25% of all our bandwidth is going on "git2_sourceware.org.git.binutils-
gdb.git.tar.gz" - i.e. downloading the source mirror binutils tarball

c) 15% is on git2_sourceware.org.git.glibc.git.tar.gz i.e. glibc

d) OE-Core has downloads.yoctoproject.org as a MIRROR

e) poky has it as a PREMIRROR

What are our options? As far as I can see we could:

a) increase the pipe from downloads.yoctoproject.org but that does come at a
non-trivial cost to the project.

b) Seek help with hosting some of the larger mirror tarballs from people better
able to host them and have that as a first premirror?

c) Switch the binutils and glibc recipes to tarballs and patches. I know Khem
finds this less convenient and they keep moving back and forward but we keep
running into this issue and having to switch back from git.

d) To soften the blow of c) we could add devupstream support to the recipes? We
could script updating the recipe to add the patches?

e) We could drop the PREMIRRORS from poky. This would stop the SCM targets from
hitting our mirrors first. That does transfer load to the upstream project SCMs
though and I'm not sure that will be appreciated. I did sent that patch, I'm not
sure about it though.

We are going to need to do *something* though as the current situation can't
continue. I'm open to other ideas...

Cheers,

Richard

I would simply drop PREMIRRORS, this is actually a privacy concern for
some of our customers that didn't realize they are leaking the names of
their internal git repositories to downloads.yoctoproject.org.

Indeed, that would be concerning for us as well. Would it be possible to
ignore PREMIRRORS based on the recipe layer? Alternatively, we could
create blocklists for heavy packages that need to fetch from upstream
first rather than drop PREMIRRORS completely. Sometimes, having a
secondary source could save valuable time when the upstream is not
responsive.

We don't have any support for "per-layer" overrides at this time which would be
the way to do that. It is something I think we probably do want to consider
adding but I haven't had the bandwidth to look at it.

I'd note that these mirrors in PREMIRRORS are also in MIRRORS already in OE-Core
so there is a fallback, it just controls the order they're tried in.

Cheers,

Richard
