How do I get meta-qt4 patches applied?  I tried to contact the maintainer listed and the email comes back undeliverable.  I have the needed patch but now way to deliver it.

Cc'd Paul Eggleton's current email. Perhaps the readme file in meta-qt4 needs updating.

My apologies - I've applied the fix and pushed it to master, thank you!

I think it's fair to say this layer is pretty much unmaintained at the moment. 
I'd be more than happy if someone wants to take it over, FWIW.
