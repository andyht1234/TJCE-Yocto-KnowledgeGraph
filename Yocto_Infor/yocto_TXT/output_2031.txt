Key Status/Updates:

*	The first release candidate build for YP 4.0 (3.5) is due next week
(Monday, 4th April)
*	YP 3.1.15 was released
*	YP 3.4.3 has passed QA and likely to be released imminently
*	We're calming down the number of changes going into the release at
this point including upgrades. For example the recent go uprev is very
unlikely to make it in at this point. If there are patches you think should
be in the release, please comment on them to show support.
*	We were able to isolate one parsing process lockup which ideally
we'd fix in the release but it is unclear if the fixes will be ready.
*	YP 4.1 planning document is available for review at:
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-g7DatSdmIETwD3xFSCxV7MbWVVkpQvQ788mIr1
MPTI/edit?usp=sharing>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-g7DatSdmIETwD3xFSCxV7MbWVVkpQvQ788mIr1M
PTI/edit?usp=sharing
*	Improvements to the documentation version number handling were made,
making things easier for release engineering and general maintenance. It
should also improve the items in the switcher dropdown menu, Please report
any issues anyone spots with the docs.
*	If people see intermittent issues in their own builds, particularly
if they're the same as intermittent issues seen on the autobuilder, please
do comment in the bugs mentioning when they happen as the frequency
information does help us prioritize fixing the most common issues.
*	Intermittent issues continue to be at high levels and help is very
much welcome in trying to resolve them. You can see the list of failures
we're continuing to see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We did work out the cause of the infamous tinfoil wait_event intermittent
issue.
