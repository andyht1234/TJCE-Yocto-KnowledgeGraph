I don't understand. With this change, we no longer build the pages we
reference here:
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/releases.html#outdated-release-manuals

Or am I missing here?

Yes, this part is indeed poorly implemented. But I don't think we can
remove the transition branch until we fix it, so I don't think we can take
this patch now.

perhaps we should maintain the overall documentation (for all versions) in
the same branch.. all these branches are making everything much
complicated.. Or perhaps we should split the documentation 'content' and
the documentation config and scripts. I am wondering how other projects are
doing it to support such complex doc setup (multiple versions to support
and to publish)!

I think we had the 'transition' pages in master initially, and we moved
that to its own branch. I believe it's something we discussed with
Richard.. but i forgot the details.

Thanks for your reviews. Good to know that the "transition" branch is
still in use in spite of what I wrongly believed.
It indeed, it's a good idea to see what other projects are doing. Maybe
what we are doing is unnecessarily complicated.

Look at Python docs (https://docs.python.org/) for example. They have a
switcher as we do, and also a left bar the latest versions and a
separate page for all versions. However, such versions are only shown on
the top page. When you enter one of the documents though for a given
version, the left bar is used for navigation between sections instead,
and you no longer have references to other versions.

Let's keep thinking about this, to find an easier to manage solution.
Thanks again
Michael.

docs.pythong.org is where we stole the idea of the switcher ;-)
Would anyone be able to figure out if their 'publishing' script is
available anywhere? if we could mimic that somehow that might be good.
