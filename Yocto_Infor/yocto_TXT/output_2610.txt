Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 3.5 Planning document:

*	There is a proposed syntax simplification on the
openembedded-architecture list with a patch on bitbake-devel. This would
phase out the use of append/prepend/remove operators with +=/=+ and mean it
would just work with "=" alone. We've not recommended this combination and
it removes a redundancy which confuses new users.
*	There will be some infrastructure down time at the end of the year
for the autobuilder and NAS, likely between the 26th and 31st December. This
will affect the autobuilder workers, downloads and sstate shares from the
project but not websites or git services. Last time we had a NAS outage it
caused some issues so we are trying to ensure those issues are fixed in the
stable branches and master with mirroring in place for key things like
uninative before then. If anyone is aware of any other failure modes we need
to address, please let us know.
*	Workarounds for the github protocol changes have been merged to all
stable branches and to master with url changes also being made in many
cases.
*	We have seen a drop in the number of patches in "Pending" state
again this week. Many thanks to everyone who has taken the time to review
patch status and handle accordingly.
*	5.15 kernel headers and kernels have been merged.
*	There have been a number of small but potentially useful bitbake
fixes to file checksum tracking, runall option handling and hung parsing
threads.
*	Intermittent issues continue to rise and help is very much welcome
on these issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to see by
searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
