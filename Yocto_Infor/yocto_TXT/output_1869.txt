Greetings,

I tried to add systemd to weston-image-core by adding the following lines in local.conf:

DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " systemd" VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"

And indeed, bitbake seems to use them in somve way:

DISTRO_FEATURES="acl alsa argp bluetooth debuginfod ext2 ipv4 ipv6 largefile pcmcia usbgadget usbhost wifi xattr nfs zeroconf pci 3g nfc x11 vfat seccomp largefile opengl ptest multiarch wayland vulkan systemd\" VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = \"systemd pulseaudio sysvinit gobject-introspection-data ldconfig"
POKY_DEFAULT_DISTRO_FEATURES="largefile opengl ptest multiarch wayland vulkan"

However, if I start the system in qemu none of  the expected systemd binaries like systemd, systemd-journal etc. is present. Did I miss something?

Regards

The INIT_MANAGER variable added in zeus removes the need to tinker with
DISTRO_FEATURES and VIRTUAL-RUNTIME* variables, all it takes to use
systemd is INIT_MANAGER = "systemd". See:

meta/conf/distro/include/init-manager-systemd.inc

for what it tweaks.

I added

INIT_MANAGER="systemd"

To local.conf. Now it complains that weston-xwayland is missing which sounds weird for core-image-weston.
Am I missing something?

Ok, correction: I complains about pam missing.

My apologies, I'd forgotten that wrinkle as we'd been sidestepping it for
a while in AGL with some custom Weston startup.  There are a few recipes
in the Weston stuff that explicitly mark pam as a required feature when
using systemd, so you'll also need to have:

DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " pam"

Apparently, this is not enough:

bitbake core-image-weston

These are my current additions to local.conf:

INIT_MANAGER="systemd"
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += " mesa-demos gdb"
IMAGE_INSTALL:append += " pam"
DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " systemd wayland pam x11" VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "sysvinit"VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""
IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE = "38048576"

pam is a DISTRO_FEATURE as below, not a package as you've added above.

^ This line what is causing your error, remove it.  With pam in
DISTRO_FEATURES the required packages will get pulled in via dependencies.

> DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " systemd wayland pam x11"

If you specify INIT_MANAGER = "systemd", then you do not need to add
systemd here.

> VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
> DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "sysvinit"
> VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""

Similarly, with INIT_MANAGER = "systemd" these 3 lines are not required.
If you look at meta/conf/distro/include/init-manager-systemd.inc you can
see what INIT_MANAGER = "systemd" tweaks.
