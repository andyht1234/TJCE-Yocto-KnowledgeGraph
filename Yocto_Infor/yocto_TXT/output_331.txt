Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.2.2 was released
*	YP 4.3 M2 has been through QA with one issue found (bug 15170) and
is being reviewed by the TSC
*	YP 3.1.27 is in QA
*	Toolchain tests have continued to improve with rust tests added and
3,344,888

tests now being run with failures reduced to 8,373 (down from 210,000).

*	Issues in the LTP test parsing were identified and fixing this
should improve the reliability of test reports.
*	The regression report for M2 is definitely improved on previous
versions with the important data becoming clearer:

 
<https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/releases/yocto-4.3_M2.rc1/testresults/test
result-regressions-report.txt>
https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/releases/yocto-4.3_M2.rc1/testresults/testr
esult-regressions-report.txt

*	We're considering switching to a pre-release version of autoconf due
to improvements in largefile/64 bit time support.
*	The project RFQ deadline has now passed, thanks to everyone who
submitted. The project aims to process the responses and respond in the next
couple of weeks.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components
which are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying
to keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex,
devtool, toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more.
Many have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
components!
*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.3. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.3_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.
*	Help us resolve CVE issues:
<https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/patchmetrics/> CVE metrics 
*	We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.
