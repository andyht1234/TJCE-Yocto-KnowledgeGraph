Hi All,

In my downstream layer, one recipe uses the ${AUTOREV} to get the very latest commit always, obviously we want the very latest changes always to build the recipes often, that’s why we assigned AUTOREV to SRCREV.

SRCREV = “${AUTOREV}”

This works fine before we integrated bitbake 2.0.5, after that it throws an error like below:

ERROR: ebsy-qa-suites-0.0-next-r0 do_fetch: Fetcher failure: Recipe uses a floating tag/branch without a fixed SRCREV yet doesn't call bb.fetch2.get_srcrev() (use SRCPV in PV for OE).

ERROR: Logfile of failure stored in: /build/tmp/work/ebsy-bullseye-amd64/ebsy-qa-suites/0.0-next-r0/temp/log.do_fetch.120

ERROR: Task (/build/../repo/recipes-core/ebsy-qa-suites/ebsy-qa-suites_0.0-next.bb:do_fetch) failed with exit code '1'

Any help would be appreciated, how to use a floating commit instead of fixed one.

Thanks,

Srinuvasan.A
