Current Dev Position: YP 4.2 M3

Next Deadline: 20th February 2023 YP 4.2 M3 Build

Key Status/Updates:

*	YP 4.0.7 and YP 4.2 M2 are in QA
*	We switched to the 6.1 kernel by default for M2. Unfortunately there
are a couple of intermittent issues that seem to have crept in. One is a
reproducibility issue in perf, likely with some host component causing it as
it only occurs on second builds. The second appears to be an intermittent
networking issue accessing a python http-server for testing dnf which
appeared after the kernel version change.
*	We are continuing to see other intermittent failures which are
limiting how quickly we can merge changes. A summary of some of the key
issues was sent to the mailing list:
<https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/message/176476>
https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/message/176476
*	There have been changes to the way the codeparser cache in bitbake
stores data which should reduce cache size, reduce the times data needs to
be written out and generally help performance.
*	CVE levels in master are still high but there are patches in
progress for most issues as I understand it.
*	We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is
appreciated.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	As people are likely aware, the project has a number of components
which are either unmaintained, or have people with little to no time trying
to keep them alive. These components include: patchtest, layerindex,
devtool, toaster, wic, oeqa, autobuilder, CROPs containers, pseudo and more.
Many have open bugs. Help is welcome in trying to better look after these
components!
*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.2. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.2_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
*	Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we're continuing to
see by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT.

Please do notice there's a new public article by RP:
https://www.linux.com/audience/maintainer-confidential-opportunities-and-challenges-of-the-ubiquitous-but-under-resourced-yocto-project/

"Maintainer confidential: Opportunities and challenges of the
ubiquitous but under-resourced Yocto Project.
Maintainers are an important topic of discussion. I’ve read a few
perspectives, but I’d like to share mine as one of the lesser-known
maintainers in the open source world."

LWN has picked it up as well:
https://lwn.net/Articles/921646
(many of the comments are the usual 'yocto is hard' fare, which should
be treated like the weather - inevitable)
