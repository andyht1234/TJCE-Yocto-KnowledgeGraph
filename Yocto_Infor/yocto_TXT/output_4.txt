Greetings !

I am trying to add "etckeeper"  to yocto . I have written a recipe and added it in my Rootfs . But when I try to commit , I am getting the below error log:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

root@imx6ulevk:~# etckeeper commit "First commit of my /etc directory"

find: unrecognized: -printf

BusyBox v1.31.0 (2023-10-18 07:46:50 UTC) multi-call binary.

Usage: find [-HL] [PATH]... [OPTIONS] [ACTIONS]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tried enabling the -printf for find in busybox but I could not able to see in busybox menuconfig . Requesting your suggestions to resolve this issue.

Thanks in advance

In case busybox's "find" utility is not sufficient for you, you could 
disable "find" in busybox's config, and add the full version of find to 
your image (recipe is called findutils).

There is no need to disable find in busybox, simply make the etckeeper recipe RDEPEND on findutils.

Alternatively, make etckeeper scripts not use the find options that 
busybox does not support, that might make it portable too.
