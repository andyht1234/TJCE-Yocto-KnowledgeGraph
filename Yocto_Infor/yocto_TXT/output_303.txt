Hello,

I’m answering to myself in case some other people have the same error.
My problem mostly came from my distro, which was the same for main image
and initramfs, and which was using systemd. Because systemd depends on the
kernel, and the kernel needs the embedded initramfs, there was a circular
dependency.
The correction was to create a specific distro for initramfs, using busybox
as init manager. And of course, configuring this distro in the
multiconfig/initramfs.conf file.

So, I can now answer to some of my questions:

Yes, the BUSYBOX_MY_INITRAMFS_CONFIG is used correctly, giving me 2
different busybox configuration, one for the initramfs and one for the main
image.

I didn’t notice any side effect. Note that I’m actually using an appending
syntax (+=) so that it is still possible to define additionnal multiconfig
if the build directory.

I am still spammed by all these messages. I’d like to understand why. And
if possible, I’d also like to mute the messages I’ve seen and decided they
are not important. It doesn’t seem possible, so I may send a patch in the
future for that case.

No, it took ages because it was using systemd which is rather big, and
which has a dependency on the kernel.

The circular dependency was due to systemd. It has now disappeared…

https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/bitbake?id=ebb8b39463cef3c3d0f90f054c433b2f5256cb1a

It is also possible to write specific log configuration files to
control the different messages.

That said, see the discussion on the bitbake-devel list about this
patch and why merging it will probably prevent us debugging some kinds
of build issues in future :/.

Cheers,

Richard
