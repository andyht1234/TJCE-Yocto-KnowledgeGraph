Hi,

Strangely, my system built by Honister always has a wrong date despite
NTP service being active, has anyone got that issue from Honister?

# timedatectl status
               Local time: Wed 2021-08-04 15:17:10 UTC
           Universal time: Wed 2021-08-04 15:17:10 UTC
                 RTC time: Thu 1970-01-01 00:06:20
                Time zone: UTC (UTC, +0000)
System clock synchronized: no
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no
# ping google.com
PING google.com (142.250.70.238): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 142.250.70.238: seq=0 ttl=60 time=9.462 ms
64 bytes from 142.250.70.238: seq=1 ttl=60 time=13.289 ms

64 bytes from 142.250.70.238: seq=3 ttl=60 time=13.129 ms

I have never had date issues built by Zeus:

~# date
Thu Jan  6 09:26:35 UTC 2022
root@solar:~# timedatectl status
               Local time: Thu 2022-01-06 09:26:45 UTC
           Universal time: Thu 2022-01-06 09:26:45 UTCk
                 RTC time: Thu 2022-01-06 09:26:45
                Time zone: n/a (UTC, +0000)
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no


Thank you.

Kind regards,

jh

Try reading the journal entries for systemd-timesyncd.service and see
if it is reporting any issues.
