Runtime auto test for following platforms:
	1. MinnowBoard Turbot - 32bit
	2. Kaby Lake (7th Generation Intel(r) Core(tm) Processors)
	3. Tiger Lake (11th Generation Intel(r) Core(tm) Processors)
	4. Alder Lake-S (12th Generation Intel(r) Core(tm) Processors)
	5. Raptor Lake-P (13th Generation Intel(r) Core(tm) Processors)

The regression report for rc2 looks better!

https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/releases/yocto-4.3_M2.rc2/testresults/testresult-regressions-report.txt

I particularly liked:

"""
  Additionally, 124114 previously failing test(s) is/are now passing
"""

:)

It does more clearly show where changes occurring which is really
helpful.

Not sure why the duplicates appeared in 

https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/releases/yocto-4.3_M2.rc2/testresults/testresult-report.txt

it appears the arm build was triggered twice from the same a-full:

https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/82/builds/5203
https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/builders/82/builds/5204

and I have no idea why it did that. I'd suggest we just filter the
duplicates messages out the final report.

I am a bit puzzled by the ltp test counts and need to talk to Ross
about that.

Cheers,

Richard

Curiously, downloading:

which is different to the main testreport. Something odd is going on.

Just to further update, it looks like it depends which worker the arm
builds ran on as to which set of test results we get. If it was
ubuntu2204-arm-1 it has ~1000 syscall tests, the ubuntu1804-arm-1 has
~250. If I increase the command without output timeout from 300s to
600s that changes to ~500 but some tests still timeout.

We really need to warn if the timeout occurs so I'm working on changes
to do that as well as trying to work out how long the tests really
take.

Ultimately we may decide to disable some tests.

Cheers,

Richard
