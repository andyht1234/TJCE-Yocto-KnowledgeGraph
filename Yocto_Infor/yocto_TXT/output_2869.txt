Dear Team,

there is core-image-x11 which will be bareminimal and core-image-weston 
if you want to use wayland/weston based desktop.

if you like XFCE for desktop then close meta-openembedded and add 
meta-oe and meta-xfce to your layers and build core-image-minimal-xfce 
also see 
https://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/tree/meta-xfce/README
