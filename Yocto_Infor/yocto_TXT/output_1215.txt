I am trying to build rcar-image-minimal for RCar S4, while bitbake I'm getting do_rootfs: The postinstall intercept hook 'update_pixbuf_cache' failed error. I tried using cleanall and cleansstate but I'm still getting the same error.
Can anyone help me with issue?

Look into the logs in the rootfs build area and it might reveal the
underlying problem perhaps some missing library or qemu user mode crash
could be the reason
