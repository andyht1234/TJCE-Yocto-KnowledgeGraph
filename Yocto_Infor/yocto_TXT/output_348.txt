Greeetings !

I am trying to include "samba" into my yocto build . I can able to see *"pam_winbind.so"* in *"/build/tmp/work/cortexa7t2hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/samba/4.10.10-r0/image/lib/security"* folder.
But when I try to include samba into my image , it is absent in my Rootfile system . I am adding in "local.conf" file as below :
*
#To enable SAMBA*
*IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " samba samba-client cifs-utils  samba-ad-dc samba-base samba-common"

* Can anyone help me out to make pam_winbind.so as a part of my image .

Thanks in advance.

It is in package pam-pluginwinbind.  Please install this package.
