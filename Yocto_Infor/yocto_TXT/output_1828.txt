  given that i freed up my schedule for the upcoming week, i zipped
over to register for this week's yp virtual summit, but was told i was
being placed on a wait list. a wait list for a virtual summit? is
there a limit being put on registrations due to technical limitations
or something? seems odd.

It is odd. And it was not expected. We are aware of the issue, and have
reached out to LF Events team and asked for help.
