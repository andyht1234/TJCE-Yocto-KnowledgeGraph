Hello, Matthias.

I added `amente-cmake-native` inti DEPENDS and, indeed, I got a different error this time:

I needed to append the following lines at the end of my-first-yocto-pkg_git.bb file in order to resolve it:

In addition to the above changes, I also included instructions inside conf/local.conf file to install my first ROS2 package:
IMAGE_INSTALL_append=" ros-core my-first-yocto-pkg"
After that, I was able to bitbake the complete Yocto image, put it on the SD card, and boot the Yocto on my devkit. After sourcing ros2_setup.sh script, I entered:

ros2 pkg list command to list all available ROS2 packages on the system.

my_first_yocto_pkg package was on the list so I was happy and excited!

I wanted to do the final touch and launch the *talker* node from the packet with:

ros2 run my_first_yocto_pkg talker
However, I got the info that No executable is found ! What the heck!

Do you have any idea what I did wrong in the whole process?

Appreciate your efforts!

Sincerely,
Bojan.

Hello, Matthias.

It seems the issue was around naming. Now it works fine even without FILES:${PN} at the end of .bb file.
I am now good to move forward.

Thank you very much for your assistance. It is really appreciated.

Sincerely,
Bojan.

Dear Sirs,

I have a hard time to cross-compile and to properly include the custom ROS2 foxy package into the Yocto image. I properly added meta-ros layer and ROS2 foxy distro to our Yocto build by following instructions from here ( https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions#add-meta-ros-to-an-existing-openembedded-project ) ( Sanity Tests ( https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions#ros-2-sanity-test ) pass successfully).

I wanted to use a devtool and build a simple custom ROS2 package containing publisher and subscriber nodes. The source code of the package is on the git - link ( https://github.com/bojankoce/ros2pkg ).

I used tips and tricks from here ( https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/TipsAndTricks/Creating_Recipes_for_ROS_modules ) to create ROS2 recipes with the devtool. My custom bitbake recipe for the simple ROS2 package looks like this ( my-first-yocto-pkg_git.bb file):

DESCRIPTION = "Example of minimal publisher/subscriber using rclcpp."
LICENSE = "Apache-2.0"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://package.xml;beginline=8;endline=8;md5=3a75fd635766e2f76c3d90ee6495f310"

SRC_URI = "git://github.com/bojankoce/ros2pkg;protocol=https"

# Modify these as desired
PV = "0.1.0"
SRCREV = "1312445de2e6861d9561c0f89f4827b94c2ff6b1"

DEPENDS = "rclcpp std-msgs"

S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

# NOTE: unable to map the following CMake package dependencies: rclcpp ament_lint_auto std_msgs ros_ament_cmake
inherit ros_ament_cmake

However, when I tried to build the package with the devtool build my-first-yocto-pkg command, I get the following error:

CMake Error at CMakeLists. txt : 19 ( find_package ):
 By not providing "Findament_cmake.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
 has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
 "ament_cmake" , but CMake did not find one.

 Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ament_cmake" with
 any of the following names :

   ament_cmakeConfig. cmake
   ament_cmake - config. cmake

 Add the installation prefix of "ament_cmake" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
 "ament_cmake_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
 "ament_cmake" provides a separate development package or SDK , be sure it
 has been installed.

The issue is around ament_cmake. I included the inherit ros_ament_cmake line into the recipe but this does not help. Do you have any idea about what I am missing here? Is there any better way to cross-compile and include a custom ROS2 foxy package into the Yocto image?

Thanks in advance for your time and efforts.

Cheers,
Bojan.
