Dear all,

My goal is to have a squashfs rootfstype and ext4 data partition that get combined in an overlayfs and switched to the root during boot.
I managed to get the overlayfs and switching of root working thanks to meta-readonly-rootfs and some changes locally, but only with 2 ext4 partitions and not with a squashfs partition.
I changed the rootfs to squash fs by changing the following 2 things:

  *   Change to --fstype=squashfs in .wks file
  *   Change IMAGE_FSTYPE to "squashfs wic.bz2" although I believe this is only necessary to get a .squashfs rootfs file

Please note I am running the image on a raspberrypi3-64, and I also noticed that the cmdline.txt still had rootfstype=ext4, but after changing this to squashfs I got a kernel panic with error:
"Not syncing: vfs: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-blick(179,6)"
Which I believe means in this case that the kernel module for Squashfs is not loaded? Could someone help me out how to load this module or point out something else I am missing?

Kind regards,
Léon
