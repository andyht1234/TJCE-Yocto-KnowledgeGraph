Hi,

I'm trying to build honister on Ubuntu 14.04. This is meant as a temporary
solution until the build server can be upgraded to something recent.
For now, I got it running with extended buildtools from poky, but the build of
libnsl2-native fails. It appears that the pkgconfig step is not executed
properly since do_compile fails with a header not found error.

Has anybody done a successful build of honister on Ubuntu 14.04? Is it even
possible?

Kind regards

Daniel

Howdy!

Just pack a more recent Ubuntu into the container engine of your least dislike - docker usually does the trick well enough if you can go with its license situation, otherwise podman is an interesting option.

Greetz,
Josef

Honister is newer releases, Always check the tested sanity distros
list for honister ( 3.4.x release)

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.4.2/ref-manual/system-requirements.html#detailed-supported-distros

it seems ubuntu 18.04 is oldest tested ubuntu distro.

You might be better off trying to use a container to build, but with a 
host that old, even that might be hard. There are several container 
solutions for the project, including:

* crops - https://github.com/crops/poky-container

* pyrex - https://github.com/garmin/pyrex

* kas - https://github.com/siemens/kas

I cannot speak for Honister, but I can speak to the higher level
abstraction that is causing you issues.
The solution is to copy the (right version of the) missing header file into
the proper location in the buildtools
directory. I maintain a running list of things I have to add to buildtools
that I have posted to this list in the
past.

Building anything recent is probably not going to work as there are lots of breaking changes in Python. You need at least python 3.6 to build Honister. It took me about a month to get Hardknott to build on top of Rocko host. I would say it is more or less a no-go to cross the 3.0 Yocto boundary. Rocko is roughly equivalent to 16.04LTS distro.
