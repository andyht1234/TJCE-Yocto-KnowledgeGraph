I'm seeing some gaps and performance issues.

Examples:
1. Setting NPM_INSTALL_DEV = "1" I am rewarded with:

169
<https://github.com/meta-flutter/meta-flutter/runs/5982719348?check_suite_focus=true#step:10:169>npm
ERR! Could not install from
"../../__w/meta-flutter/rpi4-drm-dunfell-latest/raspberrypi4-64/tmp/work/aarch64-poky-linux/webthings-gateway/1.0.0+gitAUTOINC+4c600fc973-r0/git/node_modules/@babel/compat-data"
as it does not contain a package.json file.
170
<https://github.com/meta-flutter/meta-flutter/runs/5982719348?check_suite_focus=true#step:10:170>

The upstream build uses equivalent to:
    npm --user root --cache "${NPM_CACHE}" ci
    ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
    npm --cache "${NPM_CACHE}" prune --production

2. Running npm_do_configure is taking 48+ minutes.  Granted it's a large
project, but basically the configure task is running uni-proc.

Who is the POC supporting NPM on Dunfell?

Thanks,
Joel

The takeaways using inherit npm:

1. Does not support 'scoped packages'

2. fetching is not multi-threaded.  A NPM based recipe will run uni-proc
with a considerable amount of overhead; each package is pulled and cached
independently.  Whereas "npm install" or "npm ci" runs multi-threaded.

For my use case I used base.bbclass, and implemented it all manually.  The
downside with this approach is there is no long term support via DL_DIR.

A reference for others that might hit this:

Cheers,
Joel
