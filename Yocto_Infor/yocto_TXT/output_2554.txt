Hi,
I'm attempting to create a recipe for pytorch for the TX2i using a wheel file obtained from here:

https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson-version-1-10-now-available/72048

Here is what I have so far for the recipe:

```

DESCRIPTION = "NVIDIA's Python Torch"

HOMEPAGE = "https://nvidia.com"

LICENSE = "BSD-3-Clause"

LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://../LICENSE;md5=91a5dfdaccf53b27488cb3a639e986d5"

inherit setuptools3

SRC_URI = "\

file://torch-1.10.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64.whl \

file://LICENSE \

"

COMPATIBLE_MACHINE = "jetson-tx2-devkit-tx2i"

PACKAGE_ARCH = "${MACHINE_ARCH}"

S = "${WORKDIR}/${PN}-${PV}"

do_configure() {

:

}

do_compile() {

:

}

do_install() {

pip3 install ${WORKDIR}/torch-1.10.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64.whl

}

DEPENDS = "python3-pip-native"

```

When I build I get the following ambiguous error during do_install:

| WARNING: The directory '/home/ddbabich/.cache/pip' or its parent directory is not owned or is not writable by the current user. The cache has been disabled. Check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you should use sudo's -H flag.

| ERROR: torch-1.10.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

It seems like I'm missing something with the host vs. the target settings?  But I really don't have any ideas.  Any help is appreciated.
THanks
-David

I made it a little further by adding *--no-cache-dir* to the pip3 install command.  That got rid fo the warning about not being able to access the .cache/pip.  However I still have the error:

| ERROR: torch-1.10.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_ aarch64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

Are you trying to install using pip3 on target?
Note that many factors will make it tricky for python wheels with binary
content (C or Rust extensions). The python3 version must match, as will the
libraries it requires.

The wheel you listed was built for Python 3.6 (cp36) and ARM v8 (aarch64).
The error is what you would see if you were trying to install an aarch64
wheel on an x86-64 target, but other reasons could lead to that error. We
don't know what version of glibc, gcc, etc. was used and whether those are
going to be compatible.

Also, when asking questions, please tell us which release of Yocto Project
you are using, what the MACHINE you are building for is, which layers you
are using (and at what release) and other information to help us help you.

Cheers,
--Tim
