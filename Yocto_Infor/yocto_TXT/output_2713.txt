In addition to the testresult json, testimage class now also
provides the testimage task log and qemu console output log
which can be useful for debugging test failures or
even checking qemu test runs when failures did not happen.

Rather than duplicate specific file/folder names, let's copy all
that is available, and define what is published in the testimage
class itself (with appropriate folder structure if/when needed).
At the moment there's just three files, and they are copied into
folders named after image names, so there's no clutter or risk
of mixing them up with unrelated logs.

[YOCTO #14518]
