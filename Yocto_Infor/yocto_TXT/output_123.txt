Apologies, this is the correct patch

Updated inc files to allow overriding KERNEL_IMAGETYPE in local.conf

Fixed bug where dtb couldnt be found when generating KERNEL_IMAGETYPE
other then fitImage image due to KERNEL_DEVICETREE containing the dtb
directory which is not available in the DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE directory

Hi Anthony,

Thanks for the patch!

Here we are missing your Signed-off-by.

I would highly suggest to split this into two separate commits, one for 
allowing to override the KERNEL_IMAGETYPE through local.conf and another 
one for the device tree thing.

On another topic, I really feel like this is more of an issue with the 
class handling KERNEL_DEVICETREE when we're not using a fitImage don't 
you think? Otherwise all layers will have to fix this one up and I don't 
think that's the right way to go.

Cheers,
Quentin

Hi Quentin

Happy to contribute but not all that familiar with emailing patches, sorry.

I lumped them together because if you modify the KERNEL_IMAGETYPE you
trigger the bug.

I agree moving it out of the include file would be the best way to go
but if you dont have the directory in the KERNEL_DEVICETREE it will
fail to compile, quickly searching other layers are handling it
similar to how I have, probably just in a more robust way.

Regards,

Tony

The Signed-off-by needs to be present in the commit log already, it is 
not related to mailing list submission. It is added with git commit 
--signoff (or git commit -s), c.f. 
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/contributor-guide/submit-changes.html. 
You're not the first one to forget it (or not know about it), nor will 
you be the last one, so no worries :)

But... you're not modifying the KERNEL_IMAGETYPE, you're merely allow it 
to be changed. So you're technically not introducing a bug. And if we 
wanted to be pedantic, we could say that this bug can technically 
already be triggered by changing the KERNEL_IMAGETYPE in the machine 
configuration file (and not in local.conf).

If you want to make sure one cannot modify the KERNEL_IMAGETYPE and 
break the build, then you can add the commit handling the devicetree 
before the one allowing to override the image type.

This means we really need to fix this in openembedded-core! We shouldn't 
rely on all layers to fix it themselves if we can avoid it.

Quentin

Could you please provide the error log, which version of OE-Core/poky 
you're building so we know a bit where to look :) ?

Cheers,
Quentin

KERNEL_DEVICETREE is a space-separated list so we need to handle it this 
way I think?

Something like:
"""
${@os.path.basename(x) for x in (d.getVar("KERNEL_DEVICETREE") or 
"").split()
"""

but which is valid Python :) (not tested).

Otherwise, I guess this could be added to oe-core directly no? What do 
you think?

Cheers,
Quentin
