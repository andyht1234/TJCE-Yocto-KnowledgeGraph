Hello,
I found a bug when installing a toolchain sdk and the installation
path contains a dash.
Using the default directory or a path without a dash it works.

Yocto 3.0 'zeus'

$ ./fslc-x11-glibc-x86_64-meta-toolchain-cortexa9t2hf-neon-koan-toolchain-3.0.sh
FSLC X11 SDK installer version 3.0
==================================
Enter target directory for SDK (default: /opt/fslc-x11/3.0): /opt/poky/test-3.0
You are about to install the SDK to "/opt/poky/test-3.0". Proceed [Y/n]?

It's not dash, it's the new path is longer than what was reserved in ELF 
headers:

I thought there was some attempt to use chrpath or patchelf or something 
to be able to expand the ELF headers with longer paths...

Not sure what the currect status is - I've been using my own workaround 
for many years that extends the "default" toolchain location to the max 
path length and then at the end changes the install script back to the 
original default. That way all ELF headers have "interp" field pre-allocated 
to the max and the resulting SDK/toolchain can be relocated w/o issues.

Add Denis since he may have missed Sundeep's email.

The 4096 comes from PATH_MAX:

|linux/limits.h|.
|#define PATH_MAX 4096 /* # chars in a path name including nul */|

|but that does seem a tad on the long side. I'd prefer a more reasonable
limit that we have actually tested, say PATH_MAX/4 (??) and a comment in the
commit log documenting the choice.|

|Finally, we do have a test that extracts the sdk in:|

|   meta/lib/oeqa/sdk/testsdk.py|

|Can you review that code and use a long but fixed length path by
default so that we catch regressions? The path is set in:
         sdk_dir = d.expand("${WORKDIR}/testimage-sdk/")
since len(${WORKDIR} may vary, I'd like to see code that corrects
for that and results in a fix length of PATH_MAX/4 assuming that
things work with such a long path.
|

|Denis? Does that make sense and what is your work-around?
