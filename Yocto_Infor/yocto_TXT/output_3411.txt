Recently I heard somewhere that newer versions of the Linux Kernel will include the PREEMPT_RT patches, and configuration settings would be used to set how the Linux would operate in a specific system.

Does Yocto support "PREEMPT_RT", and what versions of Yocto have this option ?

Is there documentation on this feature/option ?

Thanks,
Steve

Hello Steven,

Yocto does support switching kernels and configurations, so yes Yocto does
"support" it.

However, providing a well-tested PREEMPT_RT kernel might be more an
architectural meta layer topic.

We have been using the Intel provided PREEMPT_RT kernel for x86 with good
success in a system with hard real-time requirements.
In the end we chose full task isolation approach, where one task runs in
user-space task isolation, reducing latencies even further than what
PREEMPT_RT can provide, as we did not need kernel services in our main
processing loop (after setup).

Regards,

Leon.

Yocto has supported a PREEMPT_RT kernel as long as I can remember.

There are recipes for linux-yocto-rt for the kernel itself, and a core-image-rt image recipe right in poky.

It's also pretty straightforward to use a different kernel recipe, such as one from a vendor, and apply the PREEMPT_RT patches in a .bbappend, provided the recipe version lines up with the patches.
