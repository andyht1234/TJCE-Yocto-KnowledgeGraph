Greeting,

I have a recipe that fetch a pre-built binary from a build machine using an access token. Every developer will have different access token, for obvious reason. Therefore, the token cannot be hard coded in the recipe.



Our current build setup uses a docker container (crops/poky). Our current solution looks like this:



The host OS has an environment variable containing the access token. This token is then shared with the docker container.



Once the yocto environment is source we:

export ="$BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_ADDITIONS PRIVATE_TOKEN_GIT"

where PRIVATE_TOKEN_GIT is the access token

While this strategy does work. We were wondering if there was a better way of doing this.

The question seems off-topic and CI/CD related, but unrelated to Yocto
Project in general. Although you may find experience here, I would
search on StackOverflow or the support forums on your CI/CD of choice.

GitLab supports (project) group access tokens. I have used those
instead of user access tokens in projects.

I think recent CI/CD tools have support for secrets that are not
exposed, also for during docker based builds.

Regards,

Leon.

Such access tokens are best placed into files which can be accessed
only by processes that need them, same as private ssh keys. What
executable is using it, specifically and with which protocol?

The environment variables and thus secrets are easily leaking into build
logs so I would not use them.

Instead, I would use .netrc for git and anything using curl (http
fetcher). subversion caches passwords into ~/.subversion directory once
the password has been given once.

In CI, these can be deployed automatically using ansible etc and
developers should setup these for their own machines.

Hope this helps,

-Mikko

There is not enough info in OP and I persist this is off-topic here, so no
answer can be good. See:

docker secret

Yes, with docker this is much better. Without docker options may be more
limited and also depend heavily on IT infrastructure which in real life
has meant .netrc for me. This is no means secure or even best practice
but just works. ssh keys are much better, if that is an option.

Cheers,

-Mikko
