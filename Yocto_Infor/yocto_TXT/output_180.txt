Welcome to the PHYTEC BSP-Yocto buildsystem.

Before building for the first time, you should take a look in the main
configuration file 'conf/local.conf'. There you can tweak the build system
settings and license configuration. For example you may have to accept the
Freescale/NXP GPU and VPU licence for an i.MX6 board.

Tested build target for this build configuration is:

   $ bitbake phytec-headless-image


As yesterday I managed to build the headless image with no issue I was then going to start to customise it so decided to create a layer...

bitbake-layers create-layer meta-custom-mpet

And got the no space error. Strangely enough on an old yocto directory attempting a different phytec configuration that was apparently tested I also got the same.

the disc has 1.2 TB empty, there are gBytes of ram available, nothing else running. I succesfully built an image yesterday.
It seems at the moment that I can only ever build one thing with the directory, if I want to build again or attempt a tweak of any sort I get this error. Its wrong for sure, there is plenty of space, the hint cant surely be right - you cant surely be watching over 65000 things - not realistically?

What IS the actual problem and how is it actually fixed? I cant be the only person facing this surely?

What about the inodes on the drive (df -i)? Do you still have any 
available ones left?

meta-custom-mpet is actually a path, so maybe you need to use an
absolute path here and place it somewhere else than your build
directory?

Have you tried to increase fs.inotify.max_user_watches as the error says?

$ sysctl -n fs.inotify.max_user_watches
1048576

64K might not be enough.

Does anyone know what IS enough? Watching the video series around https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTEdfwtPtNY he doesnt mention changing this size. I dont actually know what this watch manager thing is supposed to be doing, there is one command prompt doing one thing, I cant believe that it would need that many things being watched? What is it even watching for?

How about if you try it with a plain poky checkout (to the same
revision as your phytec setup)? Does it still happen?

Depends on how big your metadata layers are, so there isn't single value
which would suite everybody. But 1M works for me even for very big builds,
so it should be big enough for you as well (for whatever PHYTEC is doing).

It's watching for changes in metadata, which is a lot of files.

Well using that enormous number worked... for the moment, until when it next stops. I still would like to know what the devil is being done in my system with that one build that is consuming such a crazy number of watches, what is being watched, why etc. This is taking memory away from other things, maybe I do have a thumping great machine but just endlessly sucking bigger and bigger numbers of watches appears to me to be the wrong thing to be doing, not everyone can afford enough ram to store an encyclopedia britannicas worth of data about every grain of sand on the planet.

Thanks Martin, I have adopted your huge number and that does at least get me motoring. I would still love to know what the devil is going on, I cant imagine how anyone constructing any form of linux build requires that many things to be watched during the build. I dont think I even have that many files on my machine!

bitbake is open source, you can read what exactly it does here:
https://git.openembedded.org/bitbake/

If you're afraid that number of watches will eat your thumping great
machine, then maybe you should avoid building software completely and use
that machine in toaster. Other things will eat a lot more ram, cpu and disk
once you pass the parsing phase.

The same question from 2019
https://www.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/2019-May/045221.html - you
don't need to copy encyclopedia or count grains of sand on the planet, you
can just google "yocto fs.inotify.max_user_watches" to find it.

There is a "memory resident" mode for bitbake (BB_SERVER_TIMEOUT = "X")
and for that to work reliably, bitbake needs to know when to reparse
metadata. For that reason it does track the metadata changing. In
theory it does this even when not staying resident so it can detect
changes in the metadata during builds and inform the user not to do
that and also to reduce differences in the codepaths between memory
resident and non-resident codepaths.

You might think 65k sounds a lot but in a simple OE-Core checkout,
there are 2.5k directories and 19k files.

In order to reduce system impact, bitbake only monitors directories,
not files. I'd imagine somehow you have a lot of directories being
included in the watch paths.

FWIW in a given build there are millions of files being processed. We
should only be monitoring the recipe/config files though.

So whilst that doesn't answer your question fully and I don't know
where the files are coming from, 65k is a relatively easy number to
reach in the kinds of work bitbake does.

Cheers,

Richard

Thanks Richard, nice to have a little more info, at least now I know what might be going on
