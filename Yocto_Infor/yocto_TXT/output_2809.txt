Hey Naveen,
I'm trying to build qemu-nios2 in meta-zephyr, but I'm seeing an error
in newlib:
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See https://gitlab.com/jonmason00/meta-zephyr/-/jobs/1624976601#L1158

Is there an alternative version or library I should be using to get
this to compile?

Thanks,
Jon
