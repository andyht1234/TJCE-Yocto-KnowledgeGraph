Hello all,

I'm trying to add a root password to add some security to ssh access. I
plan also to enable/ disable the ssh via GUI.

I'm using meta-atmel on a dunfell build. I've added:

INHERIT += "extrausers"
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "usermod -p $(openssl passwd mypassword) root"

And commented out:

EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES ?= "debug-tweaks"

When I try to SSH in I'm now getting:

Connection closed by 192.168.178.13 port 22

Do I need to set a password for ssh also?

Thanks

root login is disabled by default in modern ssh servers.
Either enable add allow-root-login to EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES or add
another user for this purpose.
