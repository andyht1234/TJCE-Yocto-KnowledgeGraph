Dear community,

how do I i include libcamera-apps in my image?

I have tried with:
IMAGE_INSTALL += "libcamera-apps"

But it doesn't find the libcamera-apps recipe.

Kind regards

It seems it is only available in langdale and master (mickledore) branch 
in meta-raspberrypi layer, c.f. 
https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/recipe/327281/

It is also called rpi-libcamera-apps.

Cheers,
Quentin
