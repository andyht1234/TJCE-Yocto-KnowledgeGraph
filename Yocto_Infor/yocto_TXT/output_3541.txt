I added a custom layer and under recipes-kernel I try to apply kernel config fragments:

└[ *~* ]> cat poky/meta-insidem2m/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_5.10.bbappend

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"

SRC_URI += "\

file://wext.cfg \

file://at24.cfg \

file://leds.cfg \

file://usb.cfg \

file://keyspan.cfg \

file://00-leds.patch \

"

Works fine. So far.
Today i added wext.cfg and the file itself is found among the other in

poky/build/tmp/work/beaglebone_yocto-poky-linux-gnueabi/linux-yocto/5.10.12+gitAUTOINC+67e74d52f2_cdca787784-r0
but its content is not applied to the .config.

wext.cfg has this content:

└[ *~* ]> cat poky/meta-insidem2m/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto/wext.cfg

CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXT=y

CONFIG_WEXT_CORE=y

CONFIG_WEXT_PROC=y

I don't see a dependency missing,
if I test the so far .config in two fresh linux trees, do make menuconfig in both and do this again in one tree and add then CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXT in one tree with make menucinfug I get the following diff:

└[ *~* ]> diff -Nur a/.config b/.config

*--- a/.config 2021-04-26 15:16:24.425877434 +0200*

*+++ b/.config 2021-04-26 15:15:42.797926593 +0200*

Does somebody have a hint what's going on here? As said the other fragments are properly applied...
