Subject: [PATCH v2] bitbake/fetch2: Add a new variable 'BB_FETCH_ENV' to export Fetcher env

The environment variables used by Fetcher are hard-coded, and are obtained
from HOST env instead of bitbake datastore
This patch add a new variable 'BB_FETCH_ENV',and modify the default
BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE_OE for backwards compatibility, trying to fix the
problems above.

Signed-off-by: Mingrui Ren <jiladahe1997@gmail.com>

changes in v2:
     a.changes the variable name from 'FETCH_ENV_WHITELIST' to 'BB_FETCH_ENV'.
     b.add 'BB_FETCH_ENV' in local.conf, rather than export it in host
       enviroment.
     c.modify existing BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE_OE for backwards compatibility.
     d.Two commits recently modified this variable. The commit ID is:
       348384135272ae7c62a11eeabcc43eddc957811f and 5dce2f3da20a14c0eb5229696561b0c5f6fce54c,
       So I adjusted the new variables in the patch.

Hi,

Thanks for the patch. This isn't ready to be merged yet though as there are some
issues.

This isn't true, they are looked at first in bitbake's datastore, then taken
from the original host environment if not in the datastore.

Why is this a problem? You need to state what the problem is, not what the code
currently does (or in the above case doesn't do).

Firstly, I'd prefer not to move this list out of the fetcher code. Bitbake can
be in theory used standalone without the OE-Core metadata and this data makes
more sense to be maintained in the fetcher.

Please don't drop the BB_ORIGENV handling. Why is that being removed?

I'd like to see this preserved in bitbake, not in bitbake.conf in OE-Core.

I think if you leave BB_ORIGENV handling in place, these latter changes
shouldn't be needed?

If you need to be able to pass extra variables into the fetcher, I think we
could/should add API for additions rather than allowing the whole list to be
customised. Without stating which problem you're solving, guessing what you
really need is hard though. A better description of the issue you're seeing
would help a lot.

Cheers,

Richard

Thanks for your reply.

The issue I have is that I have to pass additional variables into 
fetcher. More specifically,
I'm using a git:// protocol proxy tool, which requires GIT_SOCKS_PROXY 
variable.

I have made a bit more changes in this patch, I'm trying to make the 
code'perfect'.
But as you said, we could also add an API for adding additional 
variables into fetcher,
that's safe for back compatibility, but a bit more complicated for 
furture maintainability.
Please tell me which one you prefer.


By the way, I found two recent commits on this issue:
  (commit ID)
348384135272ae7c62a11eeabcc43eddc957811f
5dce2f3da20a14c0eb5229696561b0c5f6fce54c
which means the variables used by fetcher may change frequently.

I think it's a good a feature if we could add custom variables into 
fetcher. For example,
we could fetch private code by adding username or password, or we could 
adding custom
proxy tools.


Thanks,

Mingrui Ren

I have found myself using a sed one-liner to alter that variable list
in the fetcher code in order to pass through to git the
GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL environment variable, the goal being to do git URL
rewrites via the git configuration (to pass HTTP credentials, or to use
a local repo because I didn't want to bother keeping obscure VPNs
online); it was the shortest way I could think of to achieve this.
Alternatively I could have used a PATH modification with a host tool
wrapper.
Ideally I would prefer adding a KEY += value line to a site.conf.
