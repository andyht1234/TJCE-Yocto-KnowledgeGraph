Hello

I am having a strange issue with the image that is asking for root
password, even though debug-tweaks is set.

Since this did stopped working I started setting empty-root-password
and serial-autologin-root in despair - but I always get asked for a
root password that is not set, so I can never login.

When I run bitbake -e | grep "^EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES"

I get:

EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES="debug-tweaks tools-debug tools-profile package-
management empty-root-password serial-autologin-root"

Any idea how I can find out what disturbs that?

BR
David
