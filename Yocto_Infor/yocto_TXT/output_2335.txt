Greetings,

I see more and more people using links to the lore.kernel.org archives,
for example the ones for this list: https://lore.kernel.org/yocto/

These look more convenient to use than the ones on
https://lists.yoctoproject.org/.

So what about advertising such archives on
https://www.yoctoproject.org/community/mailing-lists/, at least for the
ones which have archives on lore.kernel.org? I was thinking about just
adding an "(archives)" or "(archives / public mailbox) link at the end
of the description for each list.

What do you think?
Cheers
Michael.

Sounds fine to me.

Cheers,

Thanks for the feedback.
Done on https://www.yoctoproject.org/community/mailing-lists/

I added lore.kernel.org links when applicable, and also added the
openembedded-devel mailing list which was missing.
I could shorten "Archives / Public Inbox" by just "Public Inbox" if you
think it makes more sense.

Cheers
Michael.
