Hello there...

Hope all are doing well

I'm dealing with the Yocto Hardknott version with the Linux kernel version 5.10

Along with the default device driver packages, i have added external driver packages for the Micrel KSZ8795, 4 port LAN switch support
I have also applied the patches for the Kconfig and Makefile to integrate the drivers with the mainline kernel

For me, The driver working well and i got the all 4 LAN port working!

However, I'm facing the issue with the booting time!

As during the booting i got the following message continuous
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[  448.652491] systemd-journald[325]: /dev/kmsg buffer overrun, some messages lost.

From my side, i have updated the manuconfig as follows

CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT=19

CONFIG_LOG_CPU_MAX_BUF_SHIFT=14

CONFIG_PRINTK_SAFE_LOG_BUF_SHIFT=14

CONFIG_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT=3

CONFIG_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_QUIET=2

CONFIG_MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT=2

apart from that, in bootargs i have updated, log_buf_len=65536

still, it's not working for me!

Apart from that, because of the buffer overrun,

Journal services taking too long time to start

here is the logs from the kernel

"A start job is running for the Journal service"

And over all it's increasing the boot time!

Can anyone help me here with the best solution

Thanks
Mahendra
