Hello all,

I'm trying to figure out how to set the `nodatacow` flag on a directory in
a BTRFS image at build time.  Normally this is done by running 'chattr +c
<dir>'.  Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be something supported by
fakeroot/pseudo.  I would really like to avoid doing it at runtime, or
mounting the filesystem in loopback mode (requires root).

This seems like something that Yocto *should* be able to do.  Am I missing
something?  If not, what would be the correct place to implement something
like this?

Thanks,
James

When and how are you trying to do this?  If it’s at rootfs time then the rootfs isn’t yet in the target btrfs format but simply a directory on in your build tree, and you’ll need to test that the attrs survive the transition from a directory to a btrfs image.

Right, I'm *trying* doing this at image build time.  I've tried doing it by
adding file named base-files_%.bbappend to one of my layers:

DEPENDS:append = " e2fsprogs-native"

do_install:append() {
    # Disable COW on journal
    mkdir -p ${D}${localstatedir}/log/journal
    chattr.e2fsprogs +C ${D}/var/log/journal
}


Now, as I said, this doesn't work, since this chattr flag isn't captured by
pseudo, and my underlying ext4 file system doesn't support this flag either
(so it results in an error).

chattr.e2fsprogs: Operation not supported while setting flags on
/home/jpuderer/target/build/tmp-glibc/work/nxp_s32g-wrs-linux/base-files/3.0.14-r89/image/var/log/journal


I would *like* it if there was a way to make pseudo capture the chattr flag
in the way similar to how pseudo currently captures extended file
attributes (which is used by things like SELinux and IMA).  Failing that,
I'm hoping for some guidance on what the best way to accomplish something
like this at build time would be.

Doing it at first boot is not a great solution IMHO, since you're really
just pushing part of your build process into the first boot.
