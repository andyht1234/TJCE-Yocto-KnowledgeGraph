Hi all,

in the file poky/meta-poky/conf/distro/poky.conf there's the following comment: "We need debug symbols so that SPDX license manifests for the kernel work". I've got several questions regarding this comment:

* What does this exactly mean, i.e. what doesn't work when debug symbols aren't available? Is the SPDX license information not complete in that case, or doesn't it work at all?

* â€‹If this is needed, shouldn't it be documented as a requirement for the "create-spdx" class? Or even better: Couldn't the selection of the related kernel configuration options be done inside the "create-spdx" class so that the user doesn't have to remember to select the related kernel configuration options in the distro file?

Thank you very much in advance.

With best regards
Pascal Weisser
