I am building with zeus 3.0.4, Intel based...

I trying to learn how to introduce a patch to files brought in by packages under "dynamic -layers"... my bbappend appears not to be applying my test patch (even though no errors/warnings thrown)...

This is the package I am trying to manipulate:

/disk0/scratch/smonsees/yocto/workspace_3/meta-intel/dynamic-layers/clang-layer/recipes-opencl/igc
It contains:
files  intel-graphics-compiler_1.0.11.bb

This is my recipe to apply patch:

/disk0/scratch/smonsees/yocto/workspace_3/meta-bae/meta-limws/meta-intel/dynamic-layers/clang-layer/recipes-opencl/igc
It contains:
files  intel-graphics-compiler_1.0.11.bbappend

files - contains the file I am attempting to patch (FILE_TO_PATCH.patch)
intel-graphics-compiler_1.0.11.bbappend is setup like so, where

FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/files:"

SRC_URI += "\
    file://FILE_TO_PATCH.patch \
"

I attempted to male use of BBFILES_DYNAMIC but even though I get no error, patch is not applied.

conf/layer.conf:
BBFILES_DYNAMIC += " \
    clang-layer:$(LAYERDIR)/dynamic-layers/clang-layer/recipes-opencl/igc/*.bbappend \
"

Can you explain to me the proper way to patch files under these circumstances and where I went wrong ?

Thanks,
Steve
