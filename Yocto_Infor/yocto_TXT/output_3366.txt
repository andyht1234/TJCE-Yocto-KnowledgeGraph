Hello all,

to speed up builds, we would like to make the CI generated sstate-cache available via internet. Due to IP concerns, we don't want to make it publically available but for authenticated hosts only.

[1] indicates it is possible to serve the sstate-cache over http with basic authentication [2].

How does one set the username & password? By putting it into the URL like in the following example, or are other ways available?
```
SSTATE_MIRRORS ?= "\
file://.* http://username:password@someserver.tld/share/sstate/PATH"
```

Thank you!

There is an example in the commit you sent, so I would say:
SSTATE_MIRRORS ?= " \
file://.* http://someserver.tld/share/sstate/PATH;user=username:password;downloadfilename=PATH \n"
?

Cheers,
Quentin

Hi Quentin,

obviously I didn't read that page carefully enough. Sorry for the noise and thanks for the hint.

Cheers, Manuel
