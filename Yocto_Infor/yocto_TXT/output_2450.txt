I'm finding that if I create files/folders (prefixed with '.') in WORKDIR,
they don't get cleaned up with INHERIT += "rm_work".

Is this a feature or a bug?

I think it's an oversight that doesn't affect many people.

The rm_work code for WORKDIR is:

http://cgit.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/tree/meta/classes/rm_work.bbclass#n97

     cd ${WORKDIR}

     for dir in *

     do

         # Retain only logs and other files in temp, safely ignore

         # failures of removing pseudo folers on NFS2/3 server.

         if [ $dir = 'pseudo' ]; then

             rm -rf -- $dir 2> /dev/null || true

         elif ! echo "$excludes" | grep -q -w "$dir"; then

             rm -rf -- $dir

         fi

     done


so you can see that if you want to submit a patch to remove .FOO files,
you'd have to change the glob and exclude . and ..
The comment seems to justify doing that.


I guess one question is how common is it for 'dot' files to be there
and have people come to rely on the fact that rm_work doesn't remove them.

See some analysis below if you're interested but I think it's sensible
to also remove 'dot' files. Wait a day or so to see if anyone has a
use case that would be a problem and if not, could you send a patch?

Btw:
WORKDIR docs:
http://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html?highlight=workdir#term-WORKDIR
say that:
  "This directory is located within the TMPDIR directory structure and 
is specific to the recipe being built and the system for which it is 
being built. "
so that seems to give you carte blanche!

and there's no restriction given in the rm_work docs either:
    http://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/classes.html#ref-classes-rm-work

In a build that I have on hand:

# how many files could be cleaned up?
$ ls -d tmp-glibc/work/core2-64-wrs-linux/*/*/[a-Z]* | wc -l

2887


# how many of them are 'dot' files?
$ ls -d tmp-glibc/work/core2-64-wrs-linux/*/*/.[a-Z]* | wc -l

1


# What's the file:
$ ls -d tmp-glibc/work/core2-64-wrs-linux/*/*/.[a-Z]*

tmp-glibc/work/core2-64-wrs-linux/usleep/1.0-r0/.pc


# .pc files are usually stored in a subdirectory like:
#    tmp-glibc/work/core2-64-wrs-linux/m4/1.4.19-r0/m4-1.4.19/.pc
# how many 'proper' .pc files are there just out of curiousity?
$ ls -d tmp-glibc/work/core2-64-wrs-linux/*/*/*/.pc | wc -l

79


# Let's look at usleep:
$ ls tmp-glibc/work/core2-64-wrs-linux/usleep/1.0-r0

configure.sstate   deploy-rpms               image 
packages-split  pkgdata-pdata-input  recipe-sysroot 
sstate-install-deploy_source_date_epoch  usleep    usleep.spec

COPYING            deploy-source-date-epoch  license-destdir  patches 
       pkgdata-sysroot      recipe-sysroot-native 
sstate-install-populate_lic              usleep.1

debugsources.list  GPLv2.patch               package          pkgdata 
       pseudo               source-date-epoch      temp 
                     usleep.c


Ah it has the source in WORKDIR, that seem odd but it's a simple recipe 
with the source
provided in the recipe:
http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/tree/meta-oe/recipes-core/usleep/usleep_1.0.bb?h=master

# Let's clean it:

$ bitbake -c rm_work usleep


$ ls -a tmp-glibc/work/core2-64-wrs-linux/usleep/1.0-r0

.  ..  .pc  temp


$ bitbake -c patch usleep
$ echo $?
0

so that works and it seems there's no harm done.
