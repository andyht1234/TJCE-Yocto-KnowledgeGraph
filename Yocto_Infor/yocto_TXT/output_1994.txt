Hi all,

Currently I cannot recreate my dunfell based image because bitbake fails building go-runtime.

I think this commit did build successfully in the past, though. If I recall correctly, the problems only started when I cleaned go-runtimes sstate cache: `bitbake -c cleansstate go-runtime`.

Our CI also seems to be able to build images fine from scratch, that is, with an empty sstate cache. But the CI is building inside a docker container. I'll check that fixes things.

I'm wondering if there are some changes on my development host which affect building of go. Does the error message look familiar to someone?

```
