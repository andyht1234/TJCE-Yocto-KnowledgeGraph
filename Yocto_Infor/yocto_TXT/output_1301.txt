Key Status/Updates:

   Richard Purdie <richard.purdie@linuxfoundation.org> is on holiday and
   expects to return on 24th October.

   Patches for master are welcome on the mailing list and will be
   reviewed/tested, but will not be merged until RP has returned. Our patch
   wranglers Alex and Luca maintain staging branches at
   oe-core-contrib/abelloni/master-next and
   oe-core-contrib/lucaceresoli/master-next if you’d like to see what they’ve
   tested.
   -

   YP 3.1.20 has been released. Thanks Steve!
   -

   YP 4.1 rc2 has passed QA and has been provisionally approved for release
   by the TSC. Release is scheduled for the 28th but may happen earlier if the
   documentation is finalized.
   -

   YP 4.2 Proposed Timeline document is at:
   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5KM_3BiEsIrHBO93ULvYHQJ72NqS5U5jjwWo5bxTiY/edit?usp=sharing
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT. In
   particular there is a long-standing qemuppc failure which needs
   investigating (https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14824)


Ways to contribute:

   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
