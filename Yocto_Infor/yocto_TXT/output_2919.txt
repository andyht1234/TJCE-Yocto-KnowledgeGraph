Hello,

is it somehow possible to add the ubxtool in the gpsd-utils package?

(I use the current master branch)

Best regards,
Matthias

To add every package (into poky) by every personal wish of any Yocto
user, or not to add any package without exclusion, that is the
question?

Why not to do addition of the proprietary layer for missing package or
group of missing by the same/similar context packages???

gpsd recipe is located in meta-oe. As the ubxtool file is present in the 
build it is possible to add it. Just make sure it is installed in the 
do_install step and then that the file is added to FILES_gps-utils 
variable.

Hello Peter,

I'm not sure it's that simple.

To me it looks like the recipe has bugs in python area, or my environment / build is causing problems.
In the log.do_compile file I see messages which make me wonder:

Checking whether python program exists...no
Target Python doesn't exist - disabling Python.
python = False (default True): build Python support and modules.
GPS regression tests suppressed because socket_export or python is off.

It looks to me that everything Python specific is disabled.
Therefore I am missing on the target e.g. also the following file which should be generated:

/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gps/__init__.py
/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gps/gps.py

Can anyone confirm this?

Best regards,
Matthias

Sorry for my quick and a bit oversimplified response. I did my first 
build on an older version (3.20) where ubxtool was not built but present 
in the repo root. I see now that in 3.23 gpsd have changed concept and 
client/ubxtool.py.in is mangled through the build system to fill in some 
stuff and produce the ubxtool script.

Confirmed!

The issue is that the package gpsd requires /usr/bin/python to be 
present as described in the documentation 
(https://gitlab.com/gpsd/gpsd/-/blob/master/build.adoc#user-content-quick-start). 
This is not the case in Yocto when using python3native bbclass. As 
described in the documentation it is possible to add a symlink called 
/usr/bin/python to the python interpreter in the sysroot. You can do 
this by adding:

     ln -sf python3-native/python3 ${STAGING_BINDIR_NATIVE}/python

When scons finds /usr/bin/python the python packages are also built in 
gpsd. Then you can continue to install and package ubxtool.

Best regards,
/Peter
