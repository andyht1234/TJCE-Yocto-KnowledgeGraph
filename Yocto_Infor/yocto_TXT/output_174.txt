Howdy!

We are happy to announce this years OEDvM taking place on Friday December
1st, 2023.

Bring your topics and challenges for discussion, or just join for the
networking.

As usual, the main organization will happen through the OpenEmbedded Wiki,
with the event page being located at
https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/OEDvM_2023.12
<https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/OEDvM_2023.12>

The meeting is open to everybody, and explicitly inviting non-members to
join the conversation, and possibly the organization.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!

Greetz,
Josef, on behalf of the OpenEmbedded board
