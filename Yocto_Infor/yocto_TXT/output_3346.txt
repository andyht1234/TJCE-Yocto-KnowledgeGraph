Key Status/Updates:

*	The first milestone of 3.4, M1 is due to be built next week.
*	YP 3.1.8 is has passed QA with one minor/intermittent ptest issue
found and awaits final approval for release
*	We have a 10th anniversary T-shirt and some other Yocto Project
items (hoody, stickers, mugs etc.) now available at
<https://yoctoproject.org/shop> https://yoctoproject.org/shop (EU and
Americas sources)
*	The Yocto Project Virtual Summit was held last week and seemed
successful, thanks to everyone who helped organize it or participated.
*	Master is now at 6 open CVE issues (one should be fixed by the curl
upgrade) and hardknott is now at 14 open issues. Some pending patches to
hardknott should reduce the count further.
*	We are going to trial running the AUH more regularly to try and keep
on top of recipe upgrade issues and reduce the size of the batches being
processed.
*	The multiconfig changes in bitbake continue to cause problems, we
still need simpler test cases to reproduce issues rather than huge builds.
The existing patches seem to fix some workloads and break others. Richard is
trying to fix but trying to fix autobuilder issues and other problems and
these are slow builds to debug.
*	We have cleaned up the ptest images to be built around the minimal
image rather than being tied to sato.
*	Intermittent autobuilder issues continue to occur and are now at a
record high level. You  can see the list of failures we're continuing to see
by searching for the "AB-INT" tag in bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT>
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT

We are working to identify the load pattern on the infrastructure that seems
to trigger these.

 

Ways to contribute:

*	There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
*	There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 3.4. See:
<https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enha
ncements.2FBugs>
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_3.4_Unassigned_Enhan
cements.2FBugs
*	We'd welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the
list at:
<http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/mai
ntainers.inc>
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/main
tainers.inc and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core
mailing list. We will likely move a chunk of these to "Unassigned" soon to
help facilitate this.
