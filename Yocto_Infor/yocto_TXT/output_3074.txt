Hi,

I built Yocto iMX6ULL image on Zeus kernel 4.19, but I have following
RTC errors:

[ 3494.446265] rtc rtc0: Timeout trying to get valid LPSRT Counter read
[ 4190.088406] rtc rtc0: Timeout trying to get valid LPSRT Counter read
[ 4885.740595] rtc rtc0: Timeout trying to get valid LPSRT Counter read

I measured iMX6ULL RTC_XTALI and RTC_XTALO signals connecting to a
32.768 kHz 90 kÎ© ESR crystal, all good, not sure if it is caused by
kernel or Yocto build.

Someone suggested that I should remove the external RTC, the rationale
is that Linux is not really a real time OS, there is no battery for
supporting RTC. Appreciate your comments.

My apology if it is an off topic.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

Hello jupiter,

I have seen the same message on an i.MX6S7 (https://www.karo-electronics.com/fileadmin/download/Datasheets/TX6S-Datasheet.pdf) with kernel 5.10 (in a dunfell Yocto after I upgraded from kernel 4.14).

Since we use an external RTC on the I2C bus, I disabled the internal RTC ("snvs_rtc") in the device tree, and did not analyze the problem further.

I think it is a kernel problem, since in my case the Yocto version has not changed.

Please inform me if you find out something.

Many greetings,
Matthias

How did you disable snvs_rtc? My device tree to include imx6ull.dtsi
which don't have snvs_rtc, only has snvs-rtc-lp, so I added status =
"disabled"; to the snvs-rtc-lp node:

snvs-rtc-lp {
    compatible = "fsl,sec-v4.0-mon-rtc-lp";
     regmap = <0x16>;
     offset = <0x34>;
    status = "disabled";
}

that must be wrong, it crashed in kernel booting.

Thank you.

I only added status = "disabled": https://github.com/optimeas/linux-tx6-5.10/blob/tx6-5.10/arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6dl-tx6s-8035-smartmini-v2p3.dts#L77
