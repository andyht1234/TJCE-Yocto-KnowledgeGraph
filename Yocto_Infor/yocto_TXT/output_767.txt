I have a native tool (dotnet cli) that i use for configure/compile. It used to run fine in honister but im now having issues in kirkstone after recently upgrading. I can switch to a devshell and execute run.do_configure script without issue. Any tips to further debug would be appreciated.

Its not clear how its failing. So please describe how you built this
tool. Is it a native recipe which provides it ? if not then are you
expecting it to
come from host. If its being run but failing then share error logs.
This might help further pinpoint the problem.
