Hi,

I'm want to write a recipe to compile phytool but I'm getting the below 
error when building it with:
$ bitbake -b phytool_2.0
ERROR: Failed to spawn fakeroot worker to run 
/home/yocto/rzg_vlp_v3.0.0/build/../meta-mistysom/recipes-bringup/phytool/phytool_2.0.bb:do_install: 
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 
'/home/yocto/rzg_vlp_v3.0.0/build/tmp/sysroots-components/x86_64/pseudo-native/usr/bin/pseudo'

my bb file looks like:

[phytool_2.0.bb]
DESCRIPTION = "Recipe builds phytool utility"
# Needs to be changed to GPLv2
LICENSE = "MIT"
SRC_URI = "git://github.com/MistySOM/phytool.git"
SRCREV = "8882328c08ba2efb13c049812098f1d0cb8adf0c"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = 
"file://../git/LICENSE;md5=39bba7d2cf0ba1036f2a6e2be52fe3f0"
INHERIT += " pseudo"

python do_display_banner() {
     bb.plain("some message")
}

addtask display_banner before do_build
[/phytool_2.0.bb]

It appears like my INHERIT line does not satsify the requirement.
How can I resolve this?

Hi Marcus,

Thanks for the reference. I have since found it too and just looped it 
in with:

MAGE_INSTALL_append = " phytool"

That's a lot easier but I still would like to know about the pseudo 
error I received. I think it will come back at me at one point or another.

Ron

There is no class called "pseudo" so the inherit line is wrong. Why do
you think you need to inherit such a class?

Pseudo is usually used by tasks as needed by default.

Because bitbake gave me an error that it could not find it, hence I 
added it as a dependency.

A dependency would be something like:

DEPENDS += "pseudo-native"

however that isn't your problem.

> > Pseudo is usually used by tasks as needed by default.

The problem is your -b option usage. To quote bitbake --help:

  -b BUILDFILE, --buildfile BUILDFILE
                        Execute tasks from a specific .bb recipe directly. WARNING: Does not handle any dependencies from other
                        recipes.

As it says, it doesn't handle dependencies from other recipes like pseudo.

Cheers,

Richard
