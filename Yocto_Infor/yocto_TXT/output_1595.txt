Key Status/Updates:

   -

   YP 4.1 M2 is due to be released with one known issue
   -

   YP 3.1.18 is entering QA
   -

   There were further issues with debug file mapping discovered in master.
   Unfortunately to fix this we’d need to move away from the relative path
   calls to configure in autotools and this causes a ton of new buildpath
   warnings. There doesn’t seem much interest in fixing these kinds of issues
   and to move things forward help would be needed here.
   -

   There is a patch to rework the rust toolchain support into something
   which has tests and working cross build support. Whilst this actually
   builds and tests on the autobuilder properly (an improvement on the
   existing code), help would be needed in chasing down the remaining
   failures/warnings and any regressions from the patch.
   -

   We are managing to stay roughly on track with upstream updates and CVE
   fixing.
   -

   Help is very much welcome in trying to resolve our autobuilder
   intermittent issues. You can see the list of failures we’re continuing to
   see by searching for the “AB-INT” tag in bugzilla:
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=AB-INT


Ways to contribute:

   -

   There are bugs identified as possible for newcomers to the project:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Newcomers
   -

   There are bugs that are currently unassigned for YP 4.1. See:
   https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Bug_Triage#Medium.2B_4.1_Unassigned_Enhancements.2FBugs
   -

   We’d welcome new maintainers for recipes in OE-Core. Please see the list
   at:
   http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/tree/meta/conf/distro/include/maintainers.inc
   and discuss with the existing maintainer, or ask on the OE-Core mailing
   list. We will likely move a chunk of these to “Unassigned” soon to help
   facilitate this.
