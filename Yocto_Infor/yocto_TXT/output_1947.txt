Hello Everyone,

I am using meta-java, and I have openjdk-11 recipe.

The recipe has:

EXTRA_OECONF_append_class-native = "\
--with-boot-jdk=/usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-11-amd64 \
--enable-headless-only \
--enable-openjdk-only \
"

It fails with this error:

> 
> configure: error: The path given by --with-boot-jdk does not contain a
> valid Boot JDK

I tried to install openjdk-11 on my native build host, but the same error persists.

How can I fix this ?

Thanks,
Talel
