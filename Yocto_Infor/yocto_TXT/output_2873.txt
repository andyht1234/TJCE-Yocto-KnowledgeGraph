I have a python package hosted in an internal git repo that is currently configured to use Poetry and as such does not have a setup.py file. Yocto appears to expect a setup.py file (via inherit distutils3). It seems my two options are to either remove Poetry and convert from pyproject.toml to setup.py or set up an internal pypi host that can serve a sdist file that would have a setup.py file. Are there any other options I'm missing?

Thanks!
-Ian
