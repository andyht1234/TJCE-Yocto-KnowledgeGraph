Hi All,

I am trying to execute a script in *“pkg_postinst_ontarget_${PN}”* to configure the static IP address of the embedded board. The script executes at first boot, but *it doesn’t display echo or read messages.* These messages are required to improve user experience with the setup process.

Script is as below:

pkg_postinst_ontarget_${PN} () {

#!/bin/sh -e

# This will run on first boot

echo "Starting setup script..."

read -p "Enter the IP address: " ipAddress

read -p "Enter the netmask: " netmask

read -p "Enter network gateway: " gateway

cat >> /etc/network/interfaces << EOF

iface eth0 inet static

address $ipAddress

netmask $netmask

gateway $gateway

EOF

}

Please help me to fix the problem in displaying *echo* and *read* messages to improve user experience with the setup process.

Thanks,

Sanjay Kumar

The postinst scriptlets are script fragments and not standalone scripts.
Putting an interpreter to their first line will not work. Also, they are
not running on an interactive console, but by a helper executor, so they
have to be entirely automated.

What is the problem that you would like to solve?
